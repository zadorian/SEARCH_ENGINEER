== Overview ==

The Kingdom of Norway is a constitutional monarchy and unitary democracy in Northern Europe that shares the Scandinavian Peninsula with Sweden. The country borders Sweden to the east and shares a border with Russia and Finland in the northeast; the North Sea lies to the southwest, the North Atlantic Ocean (Norwegian Sea) to the west, and the Barents Sea to the north.  

As of 2019, Norway has one of the highest standard of living in the world, with a GDP per capita of approximately USD 65,000, which places the country in sixth place worldwide ahead of the United States, Brunei, and the United Arab Emirates per the World Bank. Norway's wealth primarily comes from its vast reserves of petroleum and natural gas that were discovered in the 1970's, however, the country also has the fisheries, shipping, and rare minerals industries.     

The history of Norway as a country started in the 9th century, when Harald Hårfagre initiated the unification of the country of what was then a patchwork of earldoms and petty kingdoms. The unification was completed in the 11th century by Harald Hardråde, a period that corresponded with the Viking era, the Christianization of the country, and the building of closer trade and cultural ties with rest of Europe. The period following the Viking era is considered to be that of "greater Norway" as territorial expansion had brought Greenland, Iceland, and the Faeroe Islands under the dominion of the Norwegian King. However, Norway was hit disproportionately to the rest of Europe by the bubonic plague in the 14th century due to its coastal geography. Weakened by the drastic fall in population, the country became a junior partner in the Kalmar Union in 1397 that was headed by Denmark, which would later become the Danish-Norwegian Union after Sweden declared independence in the 16th century. During the Danish rule, Norway converted to Protestantism and fought on the protestant side during the Thirty Years War. 

The Danish-Norwegian Union lasted for over 400 years until 1814, when the Danes found themselves on the losing side of the Napoleonic wars after having been a close ally of Napoleonic France. In the aftermath of the war, Norway was transferred to become a junior of Sweden as a reward for Sweden's alliance with Great Britain and Russia. However, in the intermission of the transfer, Norway managed to ratify a constitution, which remains the second oldest constitutions still in effect after that of the United States.      

Norway finally regained full independence in 1905 as the union with Sweden was dissolved with Swedish acceptance. In 1939, independence was interrupted again with the German invasion during World War Two that lasted until the end of the war in 1945. In the post-war era, Norway established itself as a Western country with a close relationship with the United States and became one of the first members of the NATO in 1949. Norway also became increasingly economically integrated with Europe and despite voting no on EU membership twice, joined the European Economic Area in 1994.

Regional & Local Governments 

Norway is divided into three levels of government: municipalities (kommuner), counties (fylker) and the central government, with separate elections to each one. State power is divided among the Parliament (Storting), the Government (Statsråd/Regjering), and the Norwegian Supreme Court. Although the monarch is the formal head of the country with the legal right to veto any legislation, all legislative power de facto resides with the Storting, a unicameral legislature with 169 members that are elected every four years based on party-list proportional representation of Norway's 19 counties. The Statsråd is nominally selected by the monarch with the Storting's approval and is composed of the ruling coalition of political parties in the Storting. The prime minister is appointed by the monarch every four years, and cabinet members are in turn chosen by the prime minister. Municipal and country elections typically mirror the party division observed in the Storting. The municipal councils elect a board of aldermen and a mayor; in many municipalities, councilors are also leveraged for governmental affairs. Norway is a unitary state, where the majority of power lies on the national level and the municipalities and counties have limited autonomy from the central government. 


Judicial System 

The main courts of justice in Norway are the District Courts, the Courts of Appeal, and the Supreme Court. District Courts are courts of first instance. Norway is divided into judicial districts, each with their own District Court that is assigned to one more municipalities. There are 60 District Courts in Norway. Oslo has two courts of first instance: the Oslo District Court (Oslo tingrett), which handles criminal and civil cases, and the Oslo City Registrar (Oslo byfogdembete), which handles inter alia enforcement cases, bankruptcy, probate, marriages, and the issue of official certification. Decisions in District Courts can be challenged in the Courts of Appeal, or courts of second instance, of which there are six. Each court of appeal is led by a senior judge president and is staffed with several appellate judges. The Supreme Court is the highest court in Norway; its decisions are final and cannot be appealed. Supreme Court judges are appointed by the monarch with the advice of the Judicial Appointments Board, which the monarch also appoints. These judges must retire by the age of 70. Norway does not have a separate military court system; cases pertaining to military personnel are tried before civilian courts.
