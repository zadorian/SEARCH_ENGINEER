==Corporate Registry==

Various sources of corporate records are available in Mexico.

===National Enterprise Register===

'''[https://data.inpi.fr/ Registro Público de Comercio (RPC)]'''

Mexico's National Enterprise Register is managed at the state level by the Public Registry of Commerce (RPC). The search engine supports searches by company name, number (RFC), and other characteristics. A search by director name is also available. Company pages on the Enterprise Register give basic information, including those listed below. Directors, other principals (e.g., secretaries, auditors), and UBOs (where disclosed as required) are identified, with the DOBs of directors and UBOs given.

* Name
* Corporate ID
* Activity
* Entity type
* Share capital
* Wholly-owned (Y/N)
* Branch registrations
* Date of registration with its current commercial court

Note: The company's date of ''registration'' may not be its date of ''incorporation''. Look for a date of activity commencement or historical filings to check.

'''[https://rpc.economia.gob.mx/siger2/xhtml/login/login.xhtml Registro Público de Comercio (SIGER)]'''

After registering, the website allows to search for company information according to the name of the company, its partners or the FME number (Folio Mercantil Electrónico). (''pub'', ''paid'', ''reg'')

===Commercial Court Registry Database===

'''[https://www.buholegal.com/ Buho Legal]'''

Buho Legal is a legal records research service that provides access to limited information about Mexican subjects' litigation history. Buho Legal's reports are not comprehensive as they usually provide only snapshots of case dockets and no complaints or final judgment documents. The information provided by Buho Legal (dates of filing parties, case descriptions, case status) should be used to write brief case summaries that are supplemented where possible by information identified in targeted media and government portal searches.

===Commercial Gazette Records===

'''[https://www.dof.gob.mx/ Diario Oficial de la Federación (DOF)]'''

The Official Gazette of the Federation (DOF) is Mexico's official journal and regularly publishes announcements that companies are required to make on changes made. It may be searched by company name or ID (RFC), and also by keyword, which can identify directors.

===Free Corporate Filings===

'''[https://www.sayari.com/ Sayari Graph]'''

Sayari Graph provides comprehensive information on Mexican companies, including their Constitution of Society and company records from the Mexico Public Registries of Commerce. These records include the most up-to-date share capital, officer, and ownership information available.

===Associations and Foundations===

'''[https://www.gob.mx/indesol Comisión de Fomento de las Actividades de las Organizaciones de la Sociedad Civil (CFOSC)]'''

The CFOSC is an interagency government organization that regulates civil societies, civil associations, and other NGOs. The Civil Society Search maintained by the CFOSC provides basic identification information for an NGO including date of registration, status, and a disciplinary record.

===Note on Identifying Ownership===

Ownership identification can be complex in Mexico. Always check a public company's accounts first to save time.

Mexican companies declare changes in ownership in individual filings to the corporate registries. These filings are available through the '''National Enterprise Register''', '''Buho Legal''' (for a fee), and '''Sayari Graph''' (overall best option). Scrolling down the list of filings, look for ones described as a change to share capital. Typically, these will consist of notes on a company shareholder meeting detailing the change, and then updated company statutes. If you are (very) lucky, the meeting notes will give an ownership breakdown. However, it is more likely that the change in share capital (and new/departing owners) will be described, but without a description of the status quo pre-change. You will need to work backward (and often forward from the founding statutes) to identify this. If your subject is described as having a sole shareholder, immediately move on to checking the sole shareholder's filings to identify ownership.

===Directorships===

Directorship searches are available through all of the official corporate records sources listed above, namely:

* '''[https://www.buholegal.com/ Buho Legal]''' - search by name, surname, and mm/yyyy of birth through the Advanced Search
* '''[https://www.sayari.com/ Sayari Graph]''' - search by name, surname through the Advanced Search
* '''[https://www.dof.gob.mx/ Diario Oficial de la Federación]''' - search director's "[surname, name]" as a keyword
* '''Registro Público de Comercio (RPC)''' - Provides a surname/name search for directors and sole partnerships.

Note that while a register of disqualified directors (''Fichero Nacional de Directores Descalificados'') exists in Mexico, maintained by the National Council of Commercial Court Clerks, it is not publicly accessible.

==Litigation==

Mexican litigation records are not systematically published, and names of individual parties are widely anonymized. Criminal cases are least publicized of all, but cases of public interest may be covered in the press.

===Federal Judiciary===

The courts in Mexico are divided into several levels:

1. '''Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN)''' - Mexico's highest court, composed of eleven justices.
2. '''Circuit Courts''' - Spread across 32 geographic areas called judicial circuits, with collegiate (three magistrates) and unitary (one magistrate) courts.
3. '''District Courts''' - Handle federal cases including civil, criminal, and administrative matters. Specialized courts exist in major cities.

* '''[https://www.cjf.gob.mx/ Council of the Federal Judiciary (CJF)]''' - Google site search required for all subjects.

* '''Judiciary of Baja California'''
* '''Judiciary of Baja California del Sur'''
* '''Judiciary of Campeche'''
* '''Judiciary of Chiapas'''
* '''Judiciary of Chihuahua'''

==Asset Registries==

===Property Records===

Property records in Mexico are maintained by regional land registration authorities. Searches can be conducted by address or by the owner's name. For records prior to 1980, additional specific information and a lengthy process are required.

There is a contributor who can access property records in Mexico (ask JH). It costs USD 500 per entity nationwide and takes 7 days or USD 400 if you want to search in just one state. Property searches are also a bit complicated. You can search either by using a known address to find out the owner or a search by name to find out how many properties, if any, a person has. This search only goes back to 1980. To search a property that was bought or sold prior to 1980 entails a lengthy and difficult process: it can only be searched by address (one can't search by individual or company name); several key pieces of information (the Constancia de Lote y Manzana and the Plano Catastral) have to be obtained and provided in the filing request and once filed the search usually takes about 4 months.
