==Corporate Registry==

[https://ariregister.rik.ee/index?lang=eng Centre of Registers and Information Systems] (''pub'')

The Central Commercial Register is an online service that allows searching by company name or registry code/ VAT number. Free information includes company name, registry code, status, share capital and location, and director information with the Printout of the "registry card." You can purchase annual reports, if available. The e-Business Register is a service based on the database of the registry departments of county courts.

While a free, informative and accessible resource, which particularly boasts a reverse directorship search function, a 2025 case showed that the Register's coverage for former directorships may not be total (9 current/former directorships were found out of 31 total). This may be due to incomplete record keeping for dissolved entities - note also that the reverse directorship search does not identify former shareholdings. Further research indicated that aggregator [https://ssb.ee SSB] knew the directorships which the Registry search function couldn't find. Suggest running a site search of this website in future alongside Registry directorship search.
