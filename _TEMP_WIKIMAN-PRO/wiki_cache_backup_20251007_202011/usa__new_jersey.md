==Litigation==

===Disclaimer===

We searched litigation records in New Jersey, including criminal, civil, and tax cases heard by Superior Courts, Municipal Courts, and Tax Court. We note that not all litigation records are made publicly available or are accessible online and therefore these searches should not be considered comprehensive. The information contained in these databases should not be considered a defendant's complete court history, nor is it a defendant's criminal history. Criminal histories are maintained by the New Jersey State Police.

===Legal System===

The New Jersey trial court system consists of Superior Courts, Surrogate's Courts, Municipal Courts, and Tax Court. Superior Courts have general jurisdiction over all civil and criminal cases but generally handle cases beyond the jurisdiction of other courts. Superior Courts may have parts or divisions based on case type, such as civil, criminal, family, chancery, and probate.

Municipal Courts have limited jurisdiction over some types of criminal cases. Cases typically heard by Municipal Courts include felony preliminary hearings, violations of county or municipal ordinances, most violations of motor vehicle and traffic laws, most "disorderly person" offenses and violations of fish, game and boating laws.

The New Jersey Tax Court is a specialized court that handles certain tax cases for the entire state. The Tax Court will also handle cases transferred from Superior Courts when taxation expertise is appropriate for the case.
