Latvia's '''Register of Enterprises''' provides access to a consolidated database of entities, including associations and foundations, public organisations, religious organisations and relation institutions, representative offices, public persons and authorities, political parties and organisations, and trade unions.

However, only very limited data (registration number, registration date, address and an inidicative list of filings) is available openly. '''Access to advanced data and filings is only possible by logging into the commercial register or Lursoft with eID or Latvian bank account login credentials.'''

The '''Lursoft''' database (provided by a private company) is the best one-stop shop for corporate data and information on Latvian businesses and individuals, consolidated from various databases. Current and historical information regarding rightholders (companies, associations, etc.), natural persons or legal documents, as well as statements that such information has not been entered, amended, or registered or the relevant documents have not been filed, is in most cases available. 

One can search with a subject's personal ID number and will get all current and historical data - this includes current and historical positions, membership, beneficial ownership, marriage contracts, commercial pledges - and one will also be able to get data on hits in sanctions lists, driving licenses, revoked powers, verification of power of attorney (Power of attorney register), inheritance register and publications (corporate news, media coverage). 

The range of documents available (if submitted) includes:
*registration certificates of foreign companies
*protocols/decisions of a company/organisation
*annual reports (full)
*decisions of a prosecuting authority (police letters, letters from the prosecutor's office)
*bank statements or other documents regarding the payment of equity
*memorandum of association 
*shareholders' registration
*auditor's reports
*appraisal reports
*articles of association
*amendments to the articles of association
*plans for the division of assets of the company
*receipts on the publication and 
*list of members of the board / supervisory board
*notice of resignation of a member of the board / supervisory board
*registration certificates 
*orders/request/cover notes of court bailiffs 
*statement regarding beneficial owners
*power of attorney, act of empowerment
*consent of a member of the board / executive director
*statement of the board regarding payment of equity
*consent of members of the supervisory board
*decisions/letters/protocols of public notaries

However, in order to read the publications, one must sign in through one of the following: Lursoft, Facebook or Draugiem.lv (a Latvian social media site).
