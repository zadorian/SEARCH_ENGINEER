==Bankruptcy==

Bankruptcy checks can be conducted through the litigation databases listed above although the same caveats apply in terms of uncertainty with regards to how far back the databases go and how comprehensive they are. Credit checks are not publicly available​(Bankrupcy - Indonesia )​.

===Real Estate===

There is no centralized or electronic land registry in Indonesia. Conducting land title searches in the country is complicated and requires involving third parties such as local property lawyers, notaries, and property registries​(Real estate - Indonesia)​.

==Personal Information==

If a person is a direct shareholder, a director, or a commissioner at a limited company, you can use that company's records to find their citizenship, date of birth, place of birth, ID number, and address. If you just have an individual's ID number (NIK; Nomor Induk Kependudukan), you can learn where they were initially registered and their gender and date of birth: Digits 1-6 show the province, regency, and district of registration; digits 7-12 give the date of birth in DDMMYY format (for women, 40 is added to the DD part). Digits 13-16 are unique identifiers and don't reveal useful information. Annual reports and other filings of listed companies also contain some personal information on the companies' directors, commissioners, and senior executives​(E_Indonesia personal in…)​.

==Political==

Indonesia is a sprawling country of almost 280 million people. The sole official language is Indonesian (also called Bahasa Indonesia or just Bahasa in English). It is overwhelmingly the dominant language in government bodies, the media, workplaces, and education. Most Indonesians speak one of the country's 700-plus other native languages as their mother tongue. Javanese is the most common.

Indonesia has a diverse culture with around 1300 distinct ethnic groups. Around 87% of Indonesians are Muslim, mostly practicing a moderate and syncretic form of Islam. Indonesia is a religiously pluralistic and secular country, although challenges to this have been growing in recent years. The business environment is dominated by family-owned conglomerates and state-owned firms, which receive favorable treatment from the government due to political connections.

Indonesia's current president is Joko Widodo ("Jokowi"), elected in 2016 as a political outsider promising to tackle corruption and kick-start economic growth. The next election is due in 2024, and Jokowi cannot run again. His potential replacement is his long-term rival Prabowo Subianto, a hard-line nationalist and open admirer of authoritarianism​(Politics - Indonesia )​.

==Media==

The vast majority of the local press is in Indonesian, although there are several fairly respected English-language dailies that also have online versions. Key national news sources (all of which are on Factiva) include:

Kompas – best-selling Indonesian-language daily
Jawa Pos – Indonesian-language daily
Rakyat Merdeka – Indonesian-language daily focused on politics
Tempo – highly respected weekly magazine with in-depth stories (has both English and Indonesian versions)
Jakarta Post – well-established and credible English-language daily
Jakarta Globe – alternative English-language daily (less authoritative than the Jakarta Post)
Indonesia has one of South-East Asia's most liberal media environments and many news outlets are openly critical of the country's political and economic elite. However, this criticism sometimes has repercussions, creating a degree of self-censorship. Many media companies are owned by powerful businessmen with political connections, meaning certain outlets can be biased. Reporting on sensitive topics such as the West Papua independence movement and inter-religious issues can also be restricted by official censorship or journalists' self-censorship. Some tabloid-style websites also have low journalistic standards and will publish unsubstantiated rumours​(Media - Indonesia )​.
