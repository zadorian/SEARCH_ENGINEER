===Ownership===

*generally available
:-reverse: in some cases only

In Czechia, not all companies are required to disclose their shareholders – for joint stock companies with more than one shareholder, the shareholders are not disclosed in the commercial register (though they may of course be the founding shareholders, which must be disclosed in filings).  In these cases, information on the shareholders can only be accessed through the central securities depository by certain authorized persons, such as law enforcement, tax administration, public bodies. Sole shareholders are disclosed.

===Company Types===
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
''Details''

<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
'''Limited Liability Company (s.r.o.)'''

One of the most common types of companies in the Czech Republic is the limited liability company. Such types of Czech companies must be formed with a minimum investment of CZK 1. A minimum of one stockholder and one director are essential for forming a limited liability company in the Czech Republic. The stockholders may be either natural persons or corporations. An SRO’s stockholders assume limited responsibility for the organization, meaning they are not personally liable for the various monetary loans or liabilities of the corporation.

'''Limited Partnership (k.s.)'''

In a limited partnership, the general partners are fully responsible for the monetary debts and responsibilities associated with the firm. The general partner is in charge of running the business in such types of companies in the Czech Republic. Limited partners have restricted liability and as such, they are only responsible for the value of funds they have contributed to the partnership, as specified in the articles of association of the firm.

'''General Partnership (v.o.s.)'''

A General Partnership is one of the types of business in the Czech Republic where two or more individuals jointly control and run the business that is operating under a single trade name. Partners in such businesses split their earnings and expenses equally. Every member is entirely accountable for the financial commitments and responsibilities of the partnership company. As such, each of the members in such types of Czech companies is equally and jointly liable for the monetary obligations and responsibilities of the firm. There isn’t any basic investment requirement for forming such types of companies in the Czech Republic.

'''Joint Stock Company (a.s.)'''

A JSC’s stockholders have restricted responsibility, which implies that if the business accrues difficulties or obligations, their finances are not in danger. As such, the stockholders of an AS are only financially responsible for their investment’s value. Such types of companies in the Czech Republic must have CZK 2,000,000 as the required capital in order to be formed.

This sort of corporation may be established by at least one stakeholder. The statutory authority for corporations with multiple shareholders is the board of directors, which must have at least 3 persons. A supervisory board of a minimum of 3 people is also required to be established by the joint stock corporation. The three people on the supervisory boards cannot also serve as directors of the corporation in the case of an AS firm.

'''Cooperative (Družstvo)'''

A cooperative, known as a “družstvo,” is a business that is held and operated by the individuals who consume its commodities and services. The cooperative’s main commercial objective is the societal or economical well-being of its participants, who are not individually accountable for the debts as well as liabilities of the enterprise. There isn’t any capital necessity for establishing a cooperative, however, it must possess adequate funds to operate. Such types of companies in the Czech Republic must consist of three individuals as a minimum before they may be founded.

'''Sole Proprietorship'''

Such types of business in the Czech Republic are controlled and managed by a sole person and can be established quickly and easily. In this kind of company entity, a single person operates their own firm on a self-employed basis. According to the Trade License Act, an individual can officially begin their business as a sole proprietor after they turn 18 years old. There isn’t any legal distinction between the company’s financial resources and those of the proprietor in these types of Czech businesses. As such, the firm proprietor is entirely and solely accountable for all financial debts and responsibilities of the firms.

'''Branch Office'''

A branch office in the Czech Republic is an addition to an international business that conducts business in the nation. A branch office in the Czech Republic isn’t regarded as a separate legal organization, thus, the parent firm must authorize all of its business-related decisions. Also, in such types of Czech companies, the parent firm is responsible for the duties and actions of its branch. The Czech legislation governs its formation and inclusion in the Czech commercial registry. International corporations who want to maintain a presence in the Czech Republic without establishing a distinct legal organization might consider opening a branch office there. It enables the parent business to keep oversight of the Branch office’s activities. 

'''Representative Office'''

A representative office can be established in the Czech Republic by international corporations. A representative office is only permitted to carry out market research or advertise the products and services of its holding organization. Such types of business in the Czech Republic are not permitted to go on trade or enter into agreements.</div>
