==Litigation==

===Disclaimer===

We searched litigation records in Nevada, including reported and unreported cases heard by the Supreme Court, Appellate Courts, District Courts, and limited jurisdiction courts in Clark and Washoe Counties. Not all litigation records are publicly available online. Records from counties outside Clark and Washoe typically require access via third-party services such as EZyCheck. Therefore, these searches should not be considered comprehensive.

===Legal System===

Nevada’s court system consists of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, District Courts (general jurisdiction), Justice Courts, and Municipal Courts (limited jurisdiction). District Courts handle civil claims over USD 10,000 and felony criminal cases. Justice and Municipal Courts handle misdemeanors and lower-value civil matters. Public access to online records is primarily limited to Clark and Washoe Counties. For other counties, access requires a subscription service or contacting courts directly.
