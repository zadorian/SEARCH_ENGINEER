As of July 2025, this website offered 5 free basic company reports in return for a free sign-up. Even if paid for, the basic report was EUR 6, compared to EUR 9 with the official registry (which is harder to sign up for, see below). Einforma's reports offer all background information on a company (including directors and owners, with a reverse search available but also paid for), alongside basic financial overviews (full annual reports are available for EUR 11.50) and filings (summary free, full version EUR 4). Overall, this seems like the best option at present.

As of July 2025, it was no longer possible to purchase company information through this website without a log-in as previously. This makes the official source the [https://sede.registradores.org/sede/sede-corpme-web/home?lang=en ''Registradores de Espana''] site listed above. While the official source in Spain, this website requires sign-up either through a Spanish e-gov profile, or via application including provision of an ID document scan. Pascal completed this in July 2025, but found that the next step in signing up is an up-front payment for site credit of EUR 150. Without having seen a ''Registradores'' report, Einforma (above) seems like a better value proposition, since reports are a bit cheaper and information seems better laid out.

Spain follows a civil law legal system, derived from Roman law, which relies on comprehensive legal codes rather than case law. Unlike common law systems, judicial decisions do not have a binding precedent, but they may still influence future rulings. Legal outcomes and the interpretation of codes rely heavily on strict adherence to statutory law and legal scholarship. Searchable legal databases in Spain include multiple resources that encompass various levels of courts and tribunals. These databases provide access to judicial decisions, although the focus is primarily on statutory law.
