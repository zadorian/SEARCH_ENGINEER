===Ownership===

In Romania, not all companies are required to disclose their shareholders. For joint stock companies with more than one shareholder, the shareholders are not disclosed in the commercial register. In these cases, information on the shareholders can only be accessed through the central securities depository by certain authorized persons, such as law enforcement, tax administration, and public bodies. Sole shareholders are disclosed.

====Ultimate Beneficial Ownership====
Ultimate beneficial ownership may be found through the Register of Public Sector Partners (RPVS). RPVS is a legally established list of data on public sector partners, and these partners are obliged to provide information on all direct and indirect shareholders.

A public sector partner is a natural person, a natural person-entrepreneur, and a legal entity that receives from the state, local government, and other entities of the public sector monetary payment or property above the limit specified by law.

Public sector partners are required to register with an authorized person who performs all actions related to the RPVS on behalf of the public sector partner.

===Directorship===

* Available
* Reverse: yes

===Company Types===

====Limited Liability Company (s.r.l.)====
One of the most common types of companies in Romania is the limited liability company. Such types of Romanian companies must be formed with a minimum investment of RON 200. A minimum of one shareholder and one director are essential for forming a limited liability company in Romania. The shareholders may be either natural persons or corporations. An s.r.l.'s shareholders assume limited responsibility for the organization, meaning they are not personally liable for the various monetary loans or liabilities of the corporation.

====Joint Stock Company (S.A.)====
A JSC's stockholders have restricted responsibility, which implies that if the business accrues difficulties or obligations, their finances are not in danger. As such, the stockholders of an S.A. are only financially responsible for their investment's value. Such types of companies in Romania must have RON 90,000 as the required capital in order to be formed.

====General Partnership (s.n.c.)====
A General Partnership is one of the types of business in Romania where two or more individuals jointly control and run the business that is operating under a single trade name. Partners in such businesses split their earnings and expenses equally. Every member is entirely accountable for the financial commitments and responsibilities of the partnership company.

====Limited Partnership (s.c.s.)====
In a limited partnership, the general partners are fully responsible for the monetary debts and responsibilities associated with the firm. The general partner is in charge of running the business in such types of companies in Romania. Limited partners have restricted liability and as such, they are only responsible for the value of funds they have contributed to the partnership.
