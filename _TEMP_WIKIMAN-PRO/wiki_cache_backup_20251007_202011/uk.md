==Corporate Registry==

The corporate registry's full name is the Unified State Register of Legal Entities, Individual Entrepreneurs and Public Organizations (Єдиний державний реєстр юридичних осіб, фізичних осіб-підприємців та громадських формувань) and the official portal to access it is here: https://usr.minjust.gov.ua/content/free-search

However, due to the war, it's necessary to log in with some kind of Ukrainian e-ID to access the official portal. Fortunately, there are decent third-party alternatives:

* The best experience without paying seems to be '''Clarity Project''', which allows you to search by company name (https://clarity-project.info/edrs) or individual name (https://clarity-project.info/persons). You could also try Googling a relevant piece of text (e.g. a person's name or an address) with site:clarity-project.info. Clarity Project tries to get you to pay for extras like litigation records, but most standard corporate details seem to be there for free.
* Another site worth checking is '''Youcontrol.com.ua'''. Try the in-site search function as well as Googling with site:youcontrol.com.ua. Unfortunately quite a lot of content is paywalled.
* '''Opendatabot''' allows you to search the registry too (https://opendatabot.ua/c), though these results seem less comprehensive than the others.

Note that for individuals (e.g. directors and sole proprietors), the only identifying information is full name, home address, telephone number and sometimes e-mail address. As there's no ID number or date of birth, and as addresses and contact details can change, it can be difficult to distinguish between individuals with the same name.

==Litigation==

You can access the Unified State Register of Court Decisions through this portal: https://reyestr.court.gov.ua/ 

As of July 2024, your browser is likely to tell you the site is unsafe, but if you ignore that, it works fine. It contains more than 100 million documents relating to decisions from district courts, administrative courts, appellate courts, military courts, commercial courts, the Supreme Court, the High Administrative Court, the High Anti-Corruption Court, the High Commercial Court and the High Specialized Court on Civil and Criminal Cases. However, in many cases, names of individuals are anonymised before publication.

In addition, it's worth checking this third-party website, which should in theory have the same content but seems to provide slightly different results: https://court.opendatabot.ua/
