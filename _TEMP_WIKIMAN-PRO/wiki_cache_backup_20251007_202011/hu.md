Many other sectors have dedicated procurement databases.

==Litigation==

Hungary follows a civil law legal system grounded in comprehensive legal codes rather than case law. Judicial decisions, while influential, do not set binding precedent. Legal outcomes and statutory interpretations largely depend on strict adherence to legislation and legal scholarship. Searchable legal databases cover various court levels, though data protection regulations may limit the identification of specific parties.

===National Judicial Council (Országos Bírósági Hivatal; OBH)===

===Criminal Litigation===

Criminal litigation filings are available in Hungary, although these are heavily redacted (deletion extending to names of individuals, institutions, companies, as well as any other identifiers). Due to privacy laws, names of individuals, institutions, and companies are generally redacted, and the dataset contains only a selection of judgments.

===Civil Litigation===

The database maintained by the Hungarian Curia portal (Bírósági Határozatok Gyűjteménye) and published by the Ministry of Justice aggregates decisions and judgments from civil courts in all jurisdictions across Hungary. Please note that due to privacy laws, names of individuals, institutions, and companies are generally redacted, and the dataset contains only a selection of judgments.

===Insolvency Proceedings===

Act XLIX of 1991 governs bankruptcy and liquidation for legal persons—bankruptcy aims to reorganize, while liquidation focuses on asset distribution to satisfy creditors. Personal debt settlement for natural persons is regulated by Act CV of 2015, protecting mortgage debtors. Proceedings may be initiated by debtors or creditors, with assets managed by an administrator or liquidator. These processes restrict other enforcement actions and may void acts detrimental to creditors.

Various Hungarian government bodies publish information relating to individuals' and entities' negative credit record, their compliance with fiscal regulations, and disqualifications from holding corporate roles. These databases include the insolvency register; the National Tax and Customs Administration databases, including a national list of tax debtors and of those individuals who have failed to register with the tax authority or comply with VAT payments; the Ministry of Justice register of disqualified directors.

==National Regulatory==

We were able to consult the archives of several national regulatory bodies in Hungary. Among these are the public procurement contract database, the list of companies barred from participating in public tenders or breached public contracts. In addition, we were able to review a database publishing information about companies that have been found to have unregistered employees, as well as the decisions and filings issued by the national Competition Authority.

Financial services-specific records and publications extend to the Central Bank archives, capital markets publication, the archives of the Association of Investment Funds & Management Companies, and the register of authorised financial institutions.
