==Media==

===Media Ownership===

The Bulgarian media landscape features several major groups:

United Group - A telecommunications conglomerate based in Amsterdam, owning Vivacom, Nova TV, Net Info, newspapers, and radio stations. United Group financed the acquisition of Bulsatcom by Spas Russev in exchange for infrastructure.

PPF Group - A Czech investment group that owns bTV media group and Yettel telecommunications through its subsidiary Central European Media Enterprises (CME). In 2023, PPF acquired a 9.1% stake in German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1.

Public Media - BNT (Bulgarian National Television) and BNR (Bulgarian National Radio) rely primarily on state funding and face financial challenges.

Major News Outlets:
- 24 Chasa - Largest news site with over 250,000 unique visitors daily
- Darik - Radio station with largest advertising share (3.4 million euros in 2021)
- Vesselina - Highest rated music radio station until July 2022

===Media Transparency===
Bulgaria's media environment is characterized by opaque ownership structures and high concentration. In 2023, Bulgaria moved up 20 positions in the Reporters without Borders ranking (to 71st place), but media freedom remains "fragile and insecure."

The regulatory framework follows democratic models but has implementation inconsistencies. Public registries exist but need harmonization and regular updates. There are no specific legal instruments regulating press and online media.
