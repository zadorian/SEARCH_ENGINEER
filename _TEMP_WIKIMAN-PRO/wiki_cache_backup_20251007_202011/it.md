# Italy

## Overview

Country System Overview 

Italy is a country with a long Mediterranean coastline which also includes the autonomous state of the Vatican within it's borders. Italy is currently the third most populous state in the European Union with more than 60 million inhabitants. Italy is broken up in 20 different regions; some well-known examples include Sardinia, Sicily, and Tuscany. While each region has its own idiosyncrasies, research throughout Italy is fairly consistent, with most searches covering the whole of Italy. While local searches are conducted, much of the information needed to conduct these searches are grouped in one source (like in the municipal police regulatory search, for example, which links out to the proper source for each municipality).

## Corporate Registry

Registro Imprese is the official business register of the Italian Chamber of Commerce. The site allows users to search for legal and business information on a company or a person in Italy. Full information is available with payment. This includes founding/registration date, tax identification number, comprehensive ownership records, business activities, and directors and top executives.

For individuals, reports are available only in Italian but detail all executive positions held by an individual reported with the Italian Chamber of Commerce.

Company records are retained and available for 20 years after a company is dissolved. The registry includes registrations, annual reports, other corporate filings, directors, and significant shareholders (25% or more). Companies are required to register incorporation details (including previous names), charges/mortgages, insolvency information, and file annual reports and annual confirmation statements.

"Registro Imprese is the official business register of the Italian Chamber of Commerce. The site allows the user to search for legal and business information on a company or a person in Italy. Full information is available with payment. 

This is an incredible source. For companies, you can find a ton of information including founding/registration date, tax identification number, comprehensive ownership records, business activities, and directors and top executives. Directors of companies are identified by name, birthplace, and date of birth in corporate registrations.
You can search by company name or, if you have it, search by the company's codice fiscale (tax identification number). Always pay for the detailed report which should be uploaded to Insight. For companies, reports are usually available in English.
When a message asking to confirm details pops up, you can click on one of the hyperlinks on top of the page and the message will disappear.
The website sometimes takes multiple attempts before successfully logging you in."	

InfoImprese	

Conduct internal and site searches to identify any noteworthy or supplemental information.	

Confindustria

Individual Identification					

InfoCamere/Registro Imprese	

Login: Zoho	

"Like with companies, the first step in Italian research is to search for your subject on InfoCamere. You can search by name and date of birth or by codice fiscale. Unlike with companies, reports for individuals are only available in Italian but detail all executive positions held by an individual that was reported with the Italian Chamber of Commerce. For lower profile individuals, reports may show an individual's shareholdings in various entities rather than positions.
While we usually find reports for individuals, not every individual will have a report on InfoCamere. Only subjects who have held directorships/executive positions must be reported to the Italian Chamber of Commerce. All others will not be in this database."

'''Ultimate Beneficial Ownership'''
Beneficial ownership can be found on Registro Imprese by following the chain of ownership or looking at the shareholders. Shareholders who own over 25 percent of the company's shares or voting rights are often listed.

'''Publicly Traded'''

You can find ownership information and corporate filings on the Borsa Italiana and the Registro Imprese websites for publicly traded companies. Public companies must have at least two directors and one secretary registered.

'''Privately Held'''

Registro Imprese will often have shareholder information. Ownership/subsidiaries can also sometimes be found in accounts. In the Filings section, you will find a list of documents. If there are numerous documents, you can narrow your search by keywords like "Capital," "Shares," "Annual Return," "Confirmation Statement," and "Incorporation." If there are only a few documents, please search all of them.

## Education

Education Searches & Verification  

Education verification in Italy usually requires an email to the relevant school with a signed release. You should still email the school even if you do not have a signed release as they will sometimes still verify the claim, but it is unlikely that the school will even reply. Refer below for guidance for specific schools. 

Bocconi University 

For education verification at Bocconi you can email them at conferme.titoli@unibocconi.it (including a signed release and copy of the subject's ID card) or at embas@sdabocconi.it (for master/mba degrees). 

Catholic University of the Sacred Heart 

Email only if you have a copy of the student's passport or ID and a signed release from the subject: conferme.titoli@unicatt.it 

## Litigation

### Disclaimer

Litigation records in Italy can only be accessed by interested parties and require knowledge of the place where the court hearing took place. Litigation searches are therefore limited to media sources and searches of the databases of the Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale, Italy's regional administrative courts, and that of Corte di Cassazione – Italy's third level and highest court of appeal. We found no records of *** during our searches.

Italy has a civil law legal system. Judges look to codified statutes and past legal principles rather than past judicial decisions. Comprehensive litigation records are maintained by the Italian courts and are available for search on databases such as InfoLEGES and the Supreme Court of Cassation's website.

Italy Litigation Training Video

Watch the below video for an introduction into the Italian litigation searches.

This video was made in 2017 so some things may have changed. While the video is old and we now use the wiki instead of Sharepoint, many of the links are still the same and this guidance is still applicable. It is strongly recommended that researchers watch this video before conducting Italian research for the first time. If the video does not play, try clicking the option to download the video and watch it directly through the downloaded file.
