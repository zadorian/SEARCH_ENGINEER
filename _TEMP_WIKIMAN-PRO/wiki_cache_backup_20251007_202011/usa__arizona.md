===Arizona Courts Guide===

====Arizona Superior Courts====

Superior Courts have general jurisdiction over all civil and criminal cases, except when jurisdiction is limited by law or exclusively assigned to another court. If no other court has jurisdiction to handle a particular case, Superior Courts have jurisdiction.

Superior Courts have original jurisdiction over civil cases including probate, estate, divorce, annulment of marriage, disputes over title and possession to real property, civil cases involving claims for $10,000 or more (exclusive of interest and costs), the legality of municipal ordinances, actions for forcible entry and detainer, proceedings in insolvency, actions to prevent or stop a nuisance, and naturalization.

Superior Courts have exclusive jurisdiction over felony criminal cases, but preliminary hearings for felony cases can happen in lower courts. Superior Courts share jurisdiction with Justice Courts over misdemeanors when the potential penalty does not exceed $2,500 or imprisonment for six months.

====Arizona Justice Courts====

Justice Courts have limited jurisdiction over civil and criminal cases.

Criminal cases heard by Justice Courts include search warrant applications, felony preliminary hearings, misdemeanors, domestic violence and harassment, and criminal offenses punishable by a fine not more than $2,500 or not more than six months in county jail.

Justice Courts have original jurisdiction over all civil actions that involve claims for $10,000 or less, exclusive of interest or costs. Justice Courts also handle cases involving the possession of real property, such as landlord-tenant cases, if the title or ownership of the property is not in dispute.

Justice Courts have Small Claims Court divisions that handle most civil cases when the amount in dispute no more than $3,500, exclusive of interest and costs. The Small Claims division will not handle certain types of cases, including defamation, slander, libel, class action lawsuits, specific performance, injunctive relief, disputes over the title of real property, lawsuits against the State or its employees, traffic violations, and criminal cases. There is no right to a jury trial in the Small Claims Division.

Justice Courts share jurisdiction with Superior Courts over civil cases in which the amount in dispute is no more than $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

Some Justice Courts share jurisdiction with Municipal Courts over traffic violations.

====Arizona Municipal Courts====

Municipal Courts have limited jurisdiction over misdemeanor crimes and petty offenses committed in their city or town, including criminal traffic cases and violations of city ordinances and codes. They may also hear civil traffic cases and issue search warrants, protection orders, and anti-harassment injunctions.

Municipal Courts share jurisdiction with Justice Courts over violations of State law committed within the limits of the city or town. Municipal Courts also share jurisdiction with some Justice Courts over traffic violations.

Some cities and towns may refer to their Municipal Court as a City Court or Magistrate Court. Magistrate Courts and Municipal Courts were once separate types of courts in the Arizona court system. After a statewide consolidation, Municipal Courts now have the duties and jurisdiction of both the former Municipal and Magistrate courts.

====Arizona Tax Courts====

The Arizona Tax Court hears cases regarding disputes over the imposition, assessment, or collection of any state or local tax. It has statewide jurisdiction and hears cases involving property taxes, municipal sales taxes, and state taxes. It cannot hear cases regarding federal taxes.

A small claims procedure may be used in cases regarding an owner's primary residence, property with an assessed value of $2,000,000 or less, or when the amount in dispute is less than $5,000. Small claims hearings are informal and cannot be appealed.

The Arizona Tax Court is the Tax Department of Maricopa County Superior Court. Cases are normally heard in Maricopa County, although the law allows cases to be heard in other counties at the hosting county's expense. A Deputy Clerk of the Maricopa County Superior Court serves as the Clerk of the Tax Court.

===Arizona Court Notes===

====Orders of Protection====

Injunctions Against Harassment and Domestic Violence Protection Orders can generally be filed in Superior Courts, Justice Courts, and Municipal Courts. If a Domestic Violence Protection Order involves pending cases for paternity, maternity, annulment, or divorce, the request must be filed in Superior Court.

====Specialty Court Programs====

Some Arizona courts have programs that provide treatment and social services in lieu of incarceration for some non-violent offenders with substance abuse or mental health problems. Examples include DUI/Drug Court in Coconino County, Drug Court in Maricopa County Superior Court, and Tucson Veterans Court and Tucson City Court Mental Health Division in Tucson City Court in Pima County.

====Tribal Courts====

Several Native American nations in Arizona operate their own independent judicial systems. The courts in these judicial systems are known as Tribal Courts. Tribal Courts have some civil and criminal jurisdiction and their orders may be enforced by the Arizona state court system.
