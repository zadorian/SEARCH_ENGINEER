==Corporate Registry== 

Various sources of corporate records are available in France. The sections below describe official sources first, but please note that the last source is the best "one-stop shop" for French entities.

===National Enterprise Register===

'''[https://data.inpi.fr/ Data INPI]'''

From 2023, France's National Enterprise Register has become accessible through the National Institute of Industrial Property website. The search engine supports search by company name, number (SIREN) and other characteristics. A search by director name (click "advanced search" from the homepage, and enter director name in "Representatives" below) exists on the site, but as of November 2024 was not working. Company pages on the Enterprise Register give basic information, including those listed below. Directors, other principals (e.g. secretaries, auditors) and UBOs (where disclosed as required) are identified, with the DOBs of directors and UBOs given.

*name
*corporate ID
*activity
*entity type
*share capital
*wholly-owned (Y/N)
*branch registrations
*date of registration with its current commercial court. 

Note: the company's date of ''registration'' may not be its date of ''incorporation'' - look for a date of activity commencement, or historical filings, to check. 

A second tab of the company's registry page ("Associated Documents") shows PDFs of original corporate filings, which are an invaluable source of more detailed information than the basic summary (for example, a company statute might contain a full ownership breakdown, as well as biographical details about directors/shareholders). This tab can be viewed free of charge, but you need to log in (make a free account or ask Pascal for his login details). However, the filing display function is temperamental.

===Commercial Court Registry Database===

'''[https://www.infogreffe.fr/ Infogreffe]'''

The older corporate database, maintained by the Commercial Court Registries. Compared to the National Enterprise Register, Infogreffe only offers corporate filings for a fee. However, it does offer the KBIS Extract product (for a fee), which as of July 2023, provided company directors' full DOBs and addresses (compared to the National Register, which gives only mm/yyyy and municipality of residence). Additionally, Infogreffe provides a useful directorship search (current and historical) which may be searched by name and DOB. You can also simply click on one company's director to access a list of all their directorships (not possible on National Register).

Various company details are available for free, including those listed below. A UBO declaration may be downloaded for free. Directors and other principals are listed.

*address
*trade name
*legal form
*last year's turnover (where declared)
*activity
*branch registrations
*date of registration at current Commercial Court. 
Note: the company's date of registration may not be its date of ''incorporation'' - look at historical filings (Acts and Statutes section on the company's registry page) to check. 

Further detailed documents may be obtained for a fee. The most useful of these are the KBIS current extract ("KBIS"), individual filings ("Acts and Statutes") and annual accounts. Please note that individual historical filings are likely to be available elsewhere for free (see above and below). Less useful are documents on the company's debt status (expensive), bankruptcy status (available elsewhere for free), and legal position (frequently not available).

===Commercial Gazette Records===

'''[https://www.bodacc.fr/pages/annonces-commerciales/?sort=dateparution BODACC]'''

The Official Bulletin of Civil and Commercial Announcements (BODACC) is part of France's Official Journal, and regularly publishes announcements which companies are required to make on changes made - though these are very brief. It may be searched by company name or ID (SIREN), and also by keyword, which can identify directors.

===Free Corporate Filings===

'''[https://entreprises.lefigaro.fr/ Le Figaro Entreprises]'''

This database provides basic identity data on companies and, if available, a table presenting details from their most recent accounts, which may also be downloaded. Further down the company page, a list of the company's corporate announcements as published in BODACC is given (usually not further back than approximately 2008, however, so do check BODACC too). Beyond the corporate announcements, the database lists the company's corporate filings and makes them available for free download. These are the same filings available from Infogreffe for a fee, and from the National Enterprise Register (sometimes).

Unlike the other French corporate records sources, Le Figaro Entreprises is also receptive to Google site searches, which can help identify directors alongside the other methods above.

A further, but rarely-seen, key advantage of Le Figaro Entreprises is that it sources official announcements on companies from the ''infolegale'' service (subscription otherwise required), which collects data on companies from a variety of sources - not just the BODACC and the company's own filings. These announcements can include useful information - for example information on fines applied to companies (see the October 2024 announcement in '''[https://entreprises.lefigaro.fr/lm-wind-power-blades-france-50/entreprise-797671195 this]''' example). Le Figaro Entreprises is therefore the best one-stop shop for French entities.

===Associations and Foundations===

'''[https://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/pages/associations-recherche/?sort=cronosort&disjunctive.source Official Journal]'''

The Official Journal publishes announcements by associations and foundations (charities).

===Note on identifying ownership===

This is complex in France. Always check a public company's accounts first to save time.

French companies declare changes in ownership in individual filings to the corporate registries. These filings are available through the '''National Enterprise Register''' (purportedly), '''Infogreffe''' (for a fee) and '''Figaro Entreprises''' (overall best option). Scrolling down the list of filings, look for ones described as a change to share capital. Typically, these will consist of notes on a company shareholder meeting detailing the change, and then updated company statutes. If you are (very) lucky, the meeting notes will give an ownership breakdown. However, it is more likely that the change in share capital (and new/departing owners) will be described, but without a description of the status quo pre-change. You will need to work backwards (and often, forwards from the founding statutes) to identify this. If your subject is described as having a sole shareholder, immediately move on to checking the sole shareholder's filings to identify ownership.

===Directorships===

All of the official corporate records sources listed above may be searched for an individual's ''current'' directorships, as described below. However, third-party aggregator '''[https://www.societe.com/ Société]''' is a good source of information on historic directorships. Limited information on companies is available on the website without a subscription, however, so it is best used only to identify corporate affiliations.

*'''[https://www.infogreffe.fr/ Infogreffe]''' - search by name, surname and mm/yyyy of birth through the Advanced Search
*'''[https://data.inpi.fr/ Data INPI]''' - search by name, surname through the Advanced Search
*'''[https://www.bodacc.fr/pages/annonces-commerciales/?sort=dateparution BODACC]''' - search director's "[surname, name]" as a keyword
*'''[https://entreprises.lefigaro.fr/ Le Figaro Entreprises]''' - No internal search, but director names may be searched by external site search (search director's "[surname, name]"), which should also identify historic directorships.
*'''[https://www.sirene.fr/sirene/public/recherche Sirene]''' - Provides a surname/name search for directors and sole partnerships.

Note that while a register of disqualified directors (''Fichier National des Interdits de Gérer'') exists in France, maintained by the National Council of Commercial Court Clerks, it is not publicly accessible [https://www.cngtc.fr/fr/fnig.html source].

==Litigation==

French litigation records are not systematically published, and names of individual parties are widely anonymised. Criminal cases are least publicised of all, but cases of public interest may be covered in the press.

The courts in France are divided into two parts - the judicial courts (those dealing with criminal and civil laws), and the administrative courts. Public law is applied in the administrative courts (''tribunaux administratifs''). Labour law is applied at labour courts known as ''conseils des prud'hommes''. The highest of the judiciary courts is the ''Cour de cassation'' (Supreme Court of Appeals). There are 36 courts of appeal, 161 ''tribunaux de grande instance'', and 307 ''tribunaux d'instance'' (the lowest level). At the top of the administrative courts rests the ''Conseil d'Etat'' (Council of State), with 8 courts of appeal (''cours administratives d'appel'') and 42 ''tribunaux administratifs''. 

'''Disclaimer Text'''

''Litigation records in France include civil, administrative, commercial, labour, and criminal litigation filings for the civil and administrative supreme courts (Cour de Cassation and Conseil d'Etat), the 36 local courts of appeal (Cours d'Appel and Cours d'Appel Administrative), the constitutional court (Conseil Constitutionnel), the competition court (Autorité de la Concurrence), the labour courts (Conseil des Prud'hommes), local civil and administrative high courts. Not all litigation records are available in France and names of individuals are almost systematically anonymized.''

===Civil Litigation===

'''[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/ Legifrance]'''

France's central legal database contains selected judicial judgements alongside laws and government acts. Search by subject name, although individual parties to cases will be anonymised into initials. It is possible to narrow down using ''expression exacte'' and add name variations with ''associer une autre expression'' to help narrow down results.

'''[https://juricaf.org/recherche/+/facet_pays:France Juricaf]'''

Juricaf is a database of French judgements (and worldwide Francophone Supreme Court judgements) maintained by the Ministry of Justice. For France, it mainly publishes appeal cases from the Court of Cassation, Administrative Court of Appeal and regional courts of appeal, alongside Constitutional Court and State Council administrative judgements, and scattered first-instance judgements. Individual party names are anonymised as initials.

'''[https://www.courdecassation.fr/acces-rapide-judilibre Court of Cassation]'''

France's supreme court of appeal maintains a database of anonymised appeals judgements. The website supports a Google site search, which is useful for a more precise name search.

====Private Databases====

Alongside the official sources listed above, private, paid databases are likely to have additional judgements, if budget permits. The best are:

*'''[https://www.doctrine.fr/ Doctrine]'''
*'''[https://juripredis.com/ Juri'Predis]'''
*'''[https://www.lexbase.fr/rechercher-une-jurisprudence Lexbase]'''

===Administrative Litigation===

'''[https://www.conseil-etat.fr/decisions-de-justice/jurisprudence/rechercher-une-decision-arianeweb Council of State]'''

France's supreme administrative court maintains a database of its own selected judgements and selected appeals judgements. When searching this database for any name, untick the spell check option (''correction orthographique'') as this is quite zealous. The operators ET (and), OU (or) and SAUF (except) are available, and * may be inserted as wild characters.

===Criminal Record Check===

Criminal record checks on individuals in France may only be requested by the request's subject. If one has been provided for a project, verify it using the '''[https://casier-judiciaire.justice.gouv.fr/mai-web-b3-presentation/pages/validationB3Neant/accueil.xhtml?nocid=true Criminal Records]''' site.

===Insolvency & Debt===

Corporate insolvencies are indicated by the official corporate records databases:

*'''[https://www.infogreffe.fr/ Infogreffe]'''
*'''[https://data.inpi.fr/ Data INPI]'''

Individual insolvencies may be checked for using the Official Journal's '''[https://compte.bodacc.fr/pages/annonces-retablissement-personnel/ database]''' of Personal Recoveries. Make sure to select a region of residence for the subject, which is mandatory (it is possible to search all insolvencies by region, but not nationwide).
