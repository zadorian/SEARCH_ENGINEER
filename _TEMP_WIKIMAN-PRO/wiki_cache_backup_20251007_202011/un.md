The Colorado court system includes District Courts, County Courts, Municipal Courts, Water Courts, and separate Probate and Juvenile Courts in Denver County.

District Courts have general jurisdiction over all civil and criminal cases, including felonies, general civil claims, domestic relations, probate matters, juvenile matters, adoptions, paternity, and mental health cases. They also handle divorce, child custody/support, and division of marital property. District Courts share jurisdiction over domestic violence protection orders with County and Municipal Courts.

County Courts have limited jurisdiction over misdemeanors, petty offenses, preliminary hearings, civil cases under $15,000, and landlord-tenant cases. They include Small Claims divisions for disputes under $7,500 with some exceptions. They also share jurisdiction over name changes and protection orders.

Municipal Courts hear violations of city/town ordinances and share jurisdiction over protection orders.

Water Courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases related to water rights and are located in each of Colorado’s seven major river basins.

Denver County has a separate Probate Court and a separate Juvenile Court.

===Disclaimer===

We searched litigation records in Nevada, including reported and unreported cases heard by the Supreme Court, Appellate Courts, District Courts, and limited jurisdiction courts in Clark and Washoe Counties. Not all litigation records are publicly available online. Records from counties outside Clark and Washoe typically require access via third-party services such as EZyCheck. Therefore, these searches should not be considered comprehensive.

===Legal System===

Nevada’s court system consists of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, District Courts (general jurisdiction), Justice Courts, and Municipal Courts (limited jurisdiction). District Courts handle civil claims over USD 10,000 and felony criminal cases. Justice and Municipal Courts handle misdemeanors and lower-value civil matters. Public access to online records is primarily limited to Clark and Washoe Counties. For other counties, access requires a subscription service or contacting courts directly.
