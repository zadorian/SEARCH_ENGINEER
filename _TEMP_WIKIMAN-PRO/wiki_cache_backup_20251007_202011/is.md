==Corporate Registry==

===Official Registry===

The official corporate registry can be accessed at this address: https://www.gov.il/en/service/company_extract

Here you can search by (Hebrew) company name or company number, and you can either obtain basic information for free, or a full extract for 11 shekels.

The free basic information includes Hebrew name, English name, company number, establishment date and address.

The full extract includes Hebrew name, English name, company number, establishment date, address, purpose, share capital, directors (name, citizenship, identification number, home address, date of appointment), shareholders, and a timeline of changes to these things.

===Unofficial Site===

This unofficial site has some information visible for free that's not free from the original registry: https://www.checkid.co.il/

This site doesn't allow searches by the names of directors or shareholders, but a Google site search of a person's name will bring up any mentions.

==Litigation==
For free, we can search subjects' names at this public but non-exhaustive database: https://lite.takdin.co.il/

Szaid can do fuller checks for us, using an on-the-ground lawyer, or something like that. For an individual subject, this requires the subject's identification number. If the subject is a director or shareholder of any Israeli company, you can get their identification number from the corporate registry extract for this company. As of June 2024, Szaid quoted us GBP 650 for this service for an individual.
