==Corporate Registry==

===General Company Information (incl. ownership)===

The first site to check for German companies is https://companyhouse.de. Sastre has an account on this site, and logging in makes some small improvements to what you can see. This website's layout is easily navigable, so it's good to check for a general overview. However, it's not 100% reliable, especially for historical information (including establishment date), so any information to be cited in a report should ideally be verified at https://www.unternehmensregister.de (see below). Moreover, companyhouse.de tries to charge extra for certain information, such as shareholder details, which can be obtained for free from unternehmensregister.de. Never buy any filings from companyhouse.de, because the same documents can all be obtained for free from unternehmensregister.de.

Unternehmensregister.de is very tedious to use, but it has lots of great information, all for free. Here's a step-by-step guide to using it for general corporate information (including ownership):
* In the "Schnellsuche" field on the homepage, enter the name of the company you want.
* In the results page, scroll to find the right company and click on "Registerinformationen des Registergerichts" next to its name. Note that sometimes the company you want doesn't appear at the top of the results, even if you entered the exact name, so be careful not to accidentally choose the wrong company.
* On the following page, click "Registerinformationen anzeigen".
* On the following page, click "AD" for a summary of the company's current details ("AD" stands for "aktueller Abdruck", i.e. "current extract"). For companies with names ending in "KG", this will include ownership information. For other companies, it won't.
* Instead of "AD", you can also click on "DK" in order to access specific filings. In the "DK" page, you'll see a "tree" of options with drop-down lists.
** "Dokumente zur Registernummer" contains all documents filed while the company has been registered in its current location. If the company has ever been registered in other towns/districts, there will be options for "übernommene Dokumente" from previous district courts, i.e. filings submitted while at the old locations. 
** The most commonly needed documents from the "DK" view are shareholder lists (which are only available for GmbH companies). A new list is entered whenever there's a change to the shareholder structure. Click on "Liste der Gesellschafter" and then choose the document with the most recent date to see the current owners (if there are any without dates, choose those too, in case they're the most recent). The actual document should be self-explanatory and clearly dated. By downloading all the lists (including from "übernommene Dokumente", where relevant), you can see the full ownership history.
** From the "DK" view you can also access the company's past and current statutes or articles of association under "Gesellschaftsvertrag / Satzung / Statut", as well as other corporate filings that aren't so commonly needed.
* Whether getting a current registry extract ("AD") or specific individual filings ("DK"), unternehmensregister.de works by adding the documents to your "Dokumentenkorb" ("document basket"). Where given the option, it's best to choose PDF or TIF format, rather than ZIP. Add something to the basket by clicking on "In den Dokumentenkorb legen". To actually download the document you then have to click through several pointless pages: "Dokumentenkorb ansehen", then "Zur Freischaltung", then "Jetzt freischalten", then "Zum Dokumentenkorb", then finally click on the download icon next to each document in your basket.

===Searching for an Individual's Affiliations===

If you want to identify an individual's corporate affiliations, you can search https://companyhouse.de by individuals' names (at least if you're logged in with Sastre's account). Individuals' pages on companyhouse.de should list all past and current affiliations as a director ("Geschäftsführer") or "Prokurist" ("authorized signatory"), as well as their date of birth and (most recent) place of residence. Ownership relationships aren't usually listed (though occasionally they are, especially for KG companies). The date of birth listed on companyhouse.de is reliable, but the dates of affiliations are very unreliable, so affiliations should ideally be confirmed on unternehmensregister.de as outlined above, if you're going to mention them in a report. There's no simple way to search for companies that a person owns; the best approach is to use Unternehmensregister.de to check the ownership of any companies where the subject is a director, or where you have other reason to suspect a connection.

===Company Finances===

Official annual financial statements (called Jahresabschlüsse) are available from both https://companyhouse.de and https://www.unternehmensregister.de. In terms of the statements' contents, both websites are equally reliable, though if for a given company one website doesn't have them, check the other.

On companyhouse.de, you just go to the "Jahresabschlüsse" tab on a company's page and choose the statement you want to see. If you're logged into Sastre's account, they should be free to view.

On unternehmensregister.de, first search a company's name in the "Schnellsuche" field. On the results page, for companies that have statements available, each available statement will be listed beneath the company's name, for example "Jahresabschluss zum Geschäftsjahr vom 01.01.2010 bis zum 31.12.2010" is the statement for 2010.

===Miscellaneous Notes===
* Ownership information isn't (usually?) available for AG companies, unless they publish it themselves on their website or in their annual reports.
* There's no good way to search for a given company's subsidiaries or shareholdings, but these are sometimes listed in Jahresabschlüsse.
* "Geschäftsführer" is best translated as "director" and "Prokurist" is best translated as "authorized signatory".
* Regardless of which websites you use to access German corporate records, it's best to just cite them as "German corporate records" or similar in your footnotes. Don't link directly to companyhouse.de.

==Litigation==
Germany has very stringent privacy laws, as a result of which, when court records are published, they are (almost?) always anonymised, meaning that the names of all parties are redacted (whether individuals or companies). Nonetheless, it's very quick and easy to run checks in the available databases, so we do it anyway just in case.

The first step is to go to [https://justiz.de/onlinedienste/rechtsprechung/index.php this webpage]. From here, click on "Bund" to go to the search portal for federal courts, or click on the name of one of Germany's 16 provinces (Länder) to go to the portal for that province.

On the resulting page, you usually need to click on something like "Entscheidungssuche" ("decision search") to open the search screen, then choose "Volltextsuche" ("full text search") if there are multiple search types available, and select the court(s) whose decisions you want to search (there's usually an option for all courts).

[https://www.bundesgerichtshof.de Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof; BGH)] This database holds records for decisions from the highest court in civil and criminal matters in Germany.

==Regulatory==

===Finance===

Germany's financial regulator is the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (literally the Federal Authority for the Supervision of Financial Services), which is usually known in both German and English as "Bafin". Bafin maintains a database of companies holding authorization/licences/registration related to financial services, which can be searched [https://portal.mvp.bafin.de/database/InstInfo/ here] (just enter a company's name into the "Unternehmen" field and click on "Suche"). There is no registry of individuals working in the finance sector. Obviously you can always search Bafin's website (https://www.bafin.de) for mentions of a subject.

===IT and Data Protection===
Germany has a Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information(Bundesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit) [https://www.bfdi.bund.de] as well as state authorities [https://www.datenschutz-berlin.de/] - site search

The Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) is responsible for the electricity, gas, telecommunications, post and railway markets [https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Home/home_node.html] - site search

==Asset Registries==
===Real Estate===

Property records are held by municipal property registries. However, property records cannot be viewed by people without 'legitimate interest'. This will include investigators in almost all circumstances.

==Further Public Records==

===Insolvency===

Germany has a federal database of insolvency records that can be searched for free. Just go to https://neu.insolvenzbekanntmachungen.de, click on "Bekanntmachungen suchen", chose a timespan ("Datum der Veröffentlichung"), enter a company name or surname into the field "Firma/Nachname" and click on "Suchen". For a person with a very common surname, you can narrow down the search by using the other fields, e.g. "Vorname" for given name(s), "Bundesland" for their province of residence, or "Sitz/Wohnsitz" for their town of residence. Note that if your search is too broad (i.e. results in more than 1,000 matches), you won't be shown any results.

The database contains all declarations of insolvency since 1 September 2005, and for some provinces the records go back further, with the most extensive records being for North Rhine-Westphalia, whose records go back to 1 July 2002.

[https://www.bundesanzeiger.de Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger)] The Federal Gazette publishes insolvency and bankruptcy announcements.

===Bankruptcy===

Germany has a combined personal and corporate insolvency register (searchable here https://bit.ly/3sbehvn). There are two ways of searching the register:
#Within two weeks of the filing of an insolvency notice you can find it through the unrestricted search functionality. (1) Click "Uneingeschränkte Suche" and enter the surname of the subject individual or name of the subject entity in "Firma bzw. Familiename des Schuldners". (2) Hit "Suche starten" and see the results at the bottom of the page.
#A workaround for scenario (2) is to search the subject's name on Factiva like this: (Subject name) near20 (Insolven*). Factiva archives all insolvency notices.

===Credit Checks===

Credit checks for individuals and companies are available through a service called [https://www.creditreform.com/en/contact/creditreform-germany Creditreform]. Obtaining credit checks is a legal grey area. Before performing any search, you need to pick one of several 'legitimate interests' - the reasons you can pick only describe some of our investigative scenarios.
