==Corporate Registry==

===Moneyhouse===

Moneyhouse.ch is a private third-party corporate record aggregator, and it's usually the most convenient place to start looking at corporate records. We have an account, and when logged in some extra information should be visible, so it's best to do that. 

This website has a simple search function where you can enter the name of a company or an individual, and it'll search all Swiss cantons plus Liechtenstein. If you enter an individual's name, it'll show you directorships but not ownership. 

The page for a company shows a decent amount of information, though not arranged in the most user-friendly way. 

* In the first section ("Übersicht" in German), you can see its share capital, number of employees, address, sector of business, directors' names, incorporation date and purpose (often quite a detailed and specific description), then there's the most recent corporate filing that names them (from the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce, "SHAB").
* The second section ("Auskünfte") allows you to buy various types of financial report.
* The third section ("Management") shows you current and past directors, and their dates.
* The fourth section ("Netzwerk") visually displays directorships and doesn't seem very useful.
* The fifth section ("Timeline") shows major events on a timeline.
* The sixth section ("Kennzahlen") shows some basic information already included in the first section.
* The seventh section ("Besitzverhältnisse") should in theory list the company's shareholders and shareholdings/subsidiaries, but in practice it's very often empty/incomplete.
* The eighth section ("Meldungen") lists SHAB filings.
* The ninth section ("Marken") lists brands registered with the company.

The page for an individual shows more limited information: 
* The first section ("Übersicht") only really shows their citizenship (or for Swiss citizens, canton of origin) and place of residence (town if in Switzerland, town and country if abroad) and then provides the most recent corporate filing that mentions them.
* The second tab ("Auskünfte") allows you to download a PDF containing the information from the first, third and fifth tabs.
* The third tab ("Mandate") shows a list of past and present directorships and their dates.
* The fourth tab ("Netzwerk") visualizes their connections and doesn't seem particularly useful.
* The fifth tab ("Beteiligungen") should in theory show companies in which they own shares, but in practice it's usually empty.
* The sixth tab ("Meldungen") provides a list of corporate filings that mention them.

As Moneyhouse is a third-party website, we don't usually cite it directly in our reports. To cite, we can either provide a link to an official website (see below) or just write something like "Swiss corporate records".

===Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce (SHAB)===

The Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce, generally known by its German acronym SHAB, has an official website at shab.ch. Its local names are Schweizerisches Handelsamtsblatt (German), Feuille officielle suisse du commerce (French) and Foglio ufficiale svizzero di commercio (Italian).

The SHAB contains entries for certain types of changes to corporate records, such as the establishment or dissolution of a company, the addition or removal of directors, and changes of company names. There are two search fields on the website's homepage, one for all entries since 2 September 2018 and one for all entries before that, back until 1999. 

It's worth searching this website if the information on Moneyhouse seems questionable or incomplete, which may especially be the case when a company has changed name or address.

===Official cantonal corporate registries===

Each Swiss canton has its own corporate registry, and although Moneyhouse generally does a good job of aggregating data from all of them, it's often a good idea to check the relevant official registry too, to be certain of up-to-date information. In some cases, the official registry may contain information that Moneyhouse lacks. As these registries are official, if they let you link directly to companies' pages, you can use these links as citations in your reports.

Here are the cantonal registries:

==Regulatory==

Switzerland's financial regulator is the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, which is generally known (at least in English and German) as FINMA. Its full name in German is "eidgenössische Finanzmarktaufsicht", in French "Autorité fédérale de surveillance des marchés financiers" and in Italian "Autorità federale di vigilanza sui mercati finanziari".

You can search all FINMA's different registers of authorized/licensed firms and individuals through the search function [https://www.finma.ch/de/finma-public/bewilligte-institute-personen-und-produkte/ on this page]. On the same page, below the search field, there are files containing the full lists of all authorized/licensed firms and individuals in various categories, in case you want to double-check manually.

In addition, on [https://www.finma.ch/de/bewilligung/selbstregulierungsorganisationen-sro/sro-mitglieder-suche/ this page] you can search for members of self-regulation organizations (SROs). This search may be more reliable than checking SROs' own websites.
