The Austrian National Enterprise Register, known as the Firmenbuch, is accessible online. It provides comprehensive data on all registered companies in Austria, including company name, legal form, registration number, and details on directors and shareholders. The search engine supports queries by company name, registration number, and director name.

For Austrian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the corporate registry (Firmenbuch) historically provided access to various corporate information. This included details about board members, financial statements, and ownership structures, essential for conducting detailed corporate research. The change in regulation post-RÄG 2014 reduced the amount of disclosed information for smaller entities. Medium and large companies are still subject to more comprehensive disclosure requirements. They must publicly disclose their financial reports and subsidiaries, adhering to stricter transparency regulations. This ensures that larger entities remain accountable and transparent regarding their corporate governance and financial status.

Prior to the Rechnungslegungsänderungsgesetz 2014 (RÄG 2014) that came into effect in 2016, even small companies (those not classified as mittelgroße or große under Austrian law) were required to publicly disclose their subsidiaries. This regulation changed, and small companies were no longer obligated to publicly disclose their subsidiaries, impacting transparency regarding ownership and corporate structure post-2016. This means corporate structures are sometimes available in archived corporate records from before then even for these entities!

====Privatstiftung====

Privatstiftungen are private foundations established under Austrian law, primarily used for asset management, estate planning, and sometimes charitable purposes. These entities often own assets indirectly through subsidiaries and do not typically disclose financial statements or returns publicly. This structure provides a level of financial opacity, allowing ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) to maintain a degree of anonymity and privacy in their financial dealings.

Austrian Privatstiftungen can have complex structures, often involving international holdings. These foundations may have wholly-owned subsidiaries in various countries, with significant investments in properties and other assets. The names of the board members of the Privatstiftung are publicly available, but the beneficiaries and specific financial details are usually not disclosed in Austrian records, adding another layer of confidentiality.
