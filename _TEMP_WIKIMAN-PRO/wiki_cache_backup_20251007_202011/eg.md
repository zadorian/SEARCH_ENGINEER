[http://www.egx.com.eg/English/ListedStocks.aspx The Egyptian Exchange]

Information on listed stocks, bonds, mutual funds and ETFs.

We need to engage a third-party provider in Egypt to obtain the most up-to-date available corporate filings. There are currently 2-3 options for providers. They will get you corporate incorporation info; directors; and ownership. The only exception is for Law 8 companies, for which ownership is not required to be disclosed to third-parties.	

The primary sources of corporate information in Egypt are: the Ministry of Trade and Investment (MTI) and the General Authority on Investment and Free Zones (GAFI).
	
There are also third-party corporate databases that can be searched to obtain aggregated information on companies in Egypt. One of them is an online specialised MENA database for which we have a subscription. The other is Mubasher Web Site, an aggregator of data about publicly traded MENA companies. The data comes from the respective MENA stock exchanges where the company is listed. This is searchable in English and Arabic. It will disclose known owners, directors, and subsidiaries, and basic corporate incorporation information.	
The state organisation Misr for Clearing, Settlement and Central Depository, which is the clearing house for Egyptian securities, sometimes provides profiles of Egyptian companies, but the website and the information is by no means wholly reliable. The website is not always functional and the information is sometimes outdated. A "site: search" is the best means to see if there is any information on the company in question.	

Finally, we have a subscription to a MENA corporate database through which you can also search for information on Egypt based companies on their archive at no additional cost. The report on the company from the archive is not always timestamped so it is not always evident when the company information was last updated.	

Directorships	

Directorship searches can be conducted through a MENA corporate database for which we have a subscription, by searching their online archive. Alternatively, you may engage the third-party provider of the MENA corporate database subscription to run a new check on the person's corporate interests to ensure you have the most up-to-date information. The report supplied will disclose directorships and shareholdings; percentage of shares will not be disclosed.

Egypt Court System  

Overview of the Egyptian Court System 

Supreme Constitutional Court 

The Supreme Constitutional Court is the highest judicial power. It alone undertakes the judicial control in respect of the constitutionality of the laws and regulations, and shall undertake the interpretation of the legislative texts in the manner prescribed by law. In addition, the court is empowered to settle competence disputes between the judicial and the administrative courts. 

Court of Cassation (Maḥkamet El Naqḍ) 

The Court of Cassation includes consideration of challenges brought to it by either party or by the public prosecution office. It also includes examining lawsuits related to judges' actions. In such a case, the court undertakes its role as a court of merit, rather than a court of law. It also has the power to give rulings on requests of reparations for all violated verdicts. The court issues annual collections on approved judicial principles under the title "Rulings and Principles of The Court of Cassation". 

Court of Appeal 

Courts of Appeal, some which are called Higher Courts of Appeal, have the competence to consider rulings by the courts of first instance falling under its jurisdiction, should these rulings be liable for appeal. According to the Egyptian judiciary law, there are seven courts of appeal in Egypt; in Cairo, Alexandria, Tanta, Mansoura, Ismailia, Beni Swaif and Assuit. 

Court of First Instance 

These courts of first instance have the competence to consider lawsuits filed before them as may fall under their jurisdictions, and their rulings can be subject to appeal. 

Courts of Limited Jurisdiction 

These courts have the competence to issue rulings on lawsuits of limited importance, falling under their geographical and term jurisdictions; their rulings can also be subject to appeal. 

Family Court 

Family courts provide a specialized judiciary tool that would take cognizance of such cases in an atmosphere different from that of other lawsuits. This aims to secure psychological peace for children who may be involved, especially in such cases of tutelage, divorce, alimony, custody, etc. The ultimate objective of this court is to negotiate an amicable settlement of family problems through specialized guidance bureaus.

A third-party must be engaged to manually search courts in Egypt to obtain copies of litigation records or summaries of the litigation. The cost is £950 per governorate per subject. Turnaround is 10-12 working days.  

There is no reliable online searchable database for litigation records in Egypt.  

My suggested approach is - assuming there is a HUMINT component to the case - running enquiries and seeing if litigation emerges, and then deciding on whether to engage the third party provider for the court checks.

Key regulators in Egypt include:  

GAFI (see above)- regulates free zones in Egypt;  
 
Financial Regulatory Authority, which replaced the Egyptian Insurance Supervisory Authority (EISA), the Capital Market Authority (CMA), and the Mortgage Finance Authority (MFA). It regulates the financial sector;  

Public Prosecution Office, which is the office of the attorney general, and has led most investigations into corruption from the Mubarak era in the post-2011 uprising period; and  

The Central Bank of Egypt, which sets monetary policy, which has been important over the past decade, since Egypt has a large black market for currency, and suffered a currency shortage after the 2011 uprising.

==Asset Registries==

There is no online searchable land registry database in Egypt. A third-party must be engaged to manually search the registry in Egypt to obtain copies of proerty records or summaries of the litigation. The cost is £950 per governorate per subject. Turnaround is 10-12 working days.

==Political==

Political relation records are not available online. 

Credit searches are not publicly available in Egypt, as is the case for most countries in MENA. Instead, we propose running enquiries to determine the financial status of individuals and companies in Egypt.  

Bankruptcy checks can be conducted as part of wider litigation checks on a subject. The details regarding timeframes and fees are detailed in the Litigation section. Again, more insights regarding the background of a bankruptcy is likelt 

The government of Egypt is controlled by President Abdel Fatah Al-Sisi, a former defence minister; and the military. There is a parliament that essentially functions as a rubber stamp body on Sisi's decision-making.  

Sisi has been in office since he came to power as the interim leader in a coup in June 2013. That year, the late former president Mohammed Morsi (a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has since become a designated terrorist organisation in the country) was removed after months of demonstrations against his government. Morsi was the first democratically elected president after the regime of the late Hosi Mubarak was overthrown in an uprising in 2011. Sisi was subsequently formally elected president in June 2014. He was re-elected in 2018.  

Sisi's government supports foreign direct investment in the country. The government also has spent the past six years suppressing political dissent and opposition groups, including Islamist organisations such as the Brotherhood, as well as secular activist groups. Media is increasingly subject to self-censorship due to concerns of being shut down or prosecuted by the Egyptian authorities.  

Historically, the Egyptian military has long controlled large portions of the economy, since the era of Gamal Abdel Nasser, who took power in a coup in 1956. Military organisations retain stakes across a range of industries, from defence, to textiles, agriculture, and consumer goods, such as baby formula. Under Sisi, this trend of military control has continued. The government justifies this by describing the military as a stabilising force following political and economic instability from the 2011 uprising until around 2014 when Sisi assumed the presidency.
