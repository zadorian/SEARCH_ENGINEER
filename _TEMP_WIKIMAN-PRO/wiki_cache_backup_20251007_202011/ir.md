==Corporate Registry== 

* [https://search.cro.ie/company/CompanySearch.aspx Companies Registration Office] 
Official registry. Basic background data is provided on entities through a search, but the only way to get further information is to pay for individual corporate filings, which give only a basic description of changes. 

* [https://www.solocheck.ie/ SoloCheck] - a paid-for company check service which is more expensive, but much more efficient, than the CRO. 

A basic report (EUR 4) gives background data and company director names. A full credit report (EUR 10) identifies directors (with their DOBs, address and possible other affiliations based on name and DOB combination) and shareholders, alongside giving key financials for the past five years. A list of judgements may be provided if relevant. The latter option is the best - you are highly likely to spend at least EUR 10 trying to identify directors and shareholders by buying individual filings from the CRO (EUR 2.50 each). However, you should also check:
