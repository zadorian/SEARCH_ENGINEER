==Corporate Registry==

The [https://www.lbr.lu/ '''Luxembourg Business Registers'''] website provides access to the Trade and Companies Register ("RCS"; corporate registry), Electronic Compendium of Companies and Associations (corporate announcements publication) and Register of Beneficial Owners. The latter is inaccessible as of January 2024 due to an EU ruling restricting access to beneficial ownership records.

Upon accessing the RCS, click the login link in the top left and log in "as an anonymous user", which does not require a profile. Without logging in, you will only be able to search the RCS and access basic background information on companies: name, registered address, date of incorporation, legal form, activity, and dissolution/liquidation data if applicable. 

After logging in and navigating to subject company page, additional information can be accessed through corporate filings, listed below the background information. Each filing is listed with a description stating the information changed/added upon submission of that filing. Filings dating prior to approximately 2002 will be available in a separate tab entitled "Archived files", if applicable - open the "Publication" file to see all filings with changes to company data since incorporation (and ignore the arbitrary date of "1950"). Click the "pdf" icon next to each filing to access it, and it will open in a new browser page. The site only permits a user to access one filing at once.

Filings are published in French (with German translation), and cannot be machine translated in the page due to the pdf format (try Google Translate mobile app through camera), but in a relatively intuitive submission form format. Annual accounts of international companies may be submitted in both French and English. Note the following non-standard translations of filing descriptions:

*''Exercise from [date] to [date]'' = the company's annual accounts for that period
*''social capital / social funds'' = changes to share capital (and sometimes ownership)
*''associates'' = owners
*''social object'' = company activity
*''administrators/managers'' = statutory directors / board members
*''daily management delegates'' = executives (usually CEO or Managing Director only)
*''registration'' = incorporation

The RCS also offers an extract of current data on a company for EUR 12.20. As of January 2024, the author of this guide has never had cause to spend this money, and is unaware of the extract's contents. However, given the general similarities between the Luxembourgish and French corporate filing systems, the author proposes that the information available may broadly match extracts available from the [http://3.142.143.3:4001/index.php/France#Commercial_Court_Registry_Database '''French Commercial Court Register'''].

The aforementioned Electronic Compendium of Companies and Associations also provides access to company filings, with the same information as given in the RCS. Alongside providing information on non-business entities, its main difference from the RCS is that its name search function returns all filings from companies whose name matches the search term.

Additional corporate registry resources include:
* [https://memorialc.public.lu/ Archive] of corporate announcements (not filings) published between 1997 and 2016. Receptive to site search - making it the only option for reverse director searches. Results are delivered as French-language pdfs with announcement text, brief description of changes.

'''Ownership'''

To identify a company's ownership, check '''all''' (or at least several) corporate filings bearing the "associates" description. These only present information on what was changed upon the announcement - note that this can be just a change to an individual shareholder's information (e.g. change of address). Previously-existing shareholdings omitted from a given filing will not have changed, and you will need to check previous (sometimes several) "associates" filings to identify other information; if in doubt, check how much share capital the company declared in its most recent annual report, and compare this with all known shareholdings. In cases of a change in ownership, the previous owner will be shown in strikethrough (in recent, non-archived filings) in the submission form. Also check the filings described as "social capital", as these may involve changes in existing shareholders' relative stakes. Both "associates" and "social capital" filings will present details on the change first in a submission form format, and further down include the full original corporate announcement on the change, which will describe the process and potentially rationale behind the change (but will likely limit itself to describing the ownership change only, not the full ownership structure). Such announcements (usually written in French, but sometimes in English) may also give the company's full statutes, which can give useful background information.

If there are no "associates" filings, check the first "registration" filing, which will identify the company's owners upon incorporation - but only in the section of the filing giving the original corporate announcement. If the company was incorporated before ~2002, its initial incorporation filing will be available from the "Publication" file under the "Archived files" tab. Ordinarily, the announcement will begin by stating that "on [date], before [Notary name] appeared Shareholder X and Shareholder Y... to request the formation of a company between them", then give the company's statutes, and after the statutes present a table or list of initial share capital subscriptions. After collecting initial shareholding information in this manner, be sure to then work forward and check for changes to share capital which might affect the initial ownership structure. 

Filings give natural persons' (owners and directors) full name, contact address, and date and place of birth (but not citizenship - although company establishment announcements sometimes give foreign direct shareholders' passport numbers, and also sometimes occupation). Luxembourgish corporate shareholders and directors are identified by their name and ID number. For foreign corporate shareholders and directors, the RCS gives name, country of registry, ID number, entity type, and address; note that these details' veracity can only be guaranteed as of the date of filing.


'''Directorship'''

Directorship searches are not available. Check a company's "administrators/managers" and "daily management delegates" filings to identify principals. Note that these will be submitted if a principal's data (e.g. address) changes, not just if a new person is appointed. The one-page form of information given on a principal will indicate their date of appointment at the bottom - but, if the principal was appointed for a fixed term, the appointment date indicated may actually be the date the position was most recently renewed, so it is worth checking historic records as well to confirm.

'''However''', while no specific directorship search is available, some historic information is available from archives of ''Mémorial C'', the corporate announcements section of the Luxembourg Gazette, which was discontinued in June 2016 and replaced with the Electronic Compendium of Companies and Associations referenced above. A digitised archive of announcements dated 1996-2016 is hosted on '''https://memorialc.public.lu/''' which is receptive to Chrome site search. No alternative is available for filings dating since 2016.


'''Insolvency'''

The RCS manages Luxembourg's Insolvency Register, which maintains details on corporate entities only. Every month, the RCS publishes a list of insolvencies recorded in the previous period. Archives are not available. However, if a company is currently in insolvency, this will be displayed prominently on its RCS profile page. 

A "negative certification", checking for historic insolvencies, on a subject company may be ordered for EUR 4.50.
