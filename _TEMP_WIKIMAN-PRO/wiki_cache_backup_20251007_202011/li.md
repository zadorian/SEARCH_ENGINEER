==Corporate Registry==

[http://www.registrucentras.lt/jar/p/ Centre of Registers] (''pub'', ''paid'', ''reg'')

This is the official corporate registry. Basic company information and a list of all filed documents is available for free to anyone. Detailed company information is only available to Lithuanian citizens with a Lithuanian e-ID, residency or bank account. A simple extract (called a "master data statement in electronic form") costs €3.69 and lists directors, alongside other usual basic information, but it won't contain shareholders. There are also myriad other documents that can be bought separately for similarly small fees, including financial reports and the company statute. If there's one available called "shareholders' decision", that should list the shareholders (and their respective percentages) as of the date the decision was made. If there aren't any shareholders' decisions, there probably won't be any ownership information available.

Search by director or shareholder is not available due to legislation on protecting personal information.

This is a third-party registry that provides some more information for free than the official one, and it also allows anyone to buy specific documents (the same ones available in the official registry). Usefully, as each company page typically lists current directors (for free), this site provides the only way to search for a person's Lithuanian directorships. The site doesn't contain this function itself, but you can do a Google search with the person's name and site:rekvizitai.vz.lt. Of course, these types of searches shouldn't be considered definitive/exhaustive.
