==Corporate Registry==

* [https://kbopub.economie.fgov.be/kbopub/zoeknummerform.html?lang=en Crossroads Bank for Enterprises -] Official business registry. The Federal Public Service (Ministry) of Economy maintains this corporate database. The database accepts searches by company name and number, alongside the more general categories of activity, authorisation (for regulated activities) and address. (''pub'')

Belgian entities may adopt either French or Dutch [https://www.belgium.be/en/economy/business/creation/company_formats category names] (i.e., SRL/BV for private companies and SA/BV for public companies); the difference in name does not indicate a difference in entity type. While the name can be deduced from the subject's region of registration, it's best to check in official gazette records rather than on the CBE, which will give a translation into the selected local language.

A search by name will deliver a list of names containing a given word, alongside similar spellings. Note that duplicate results with the same corporate ID may appear, but clicking on either the corporate ID or "establishment unit" number will bring you to the same company profile page. The CBE [https://economie.fgov.be/en/themes/enterprises/crossroads-bank-enterprises/registration-crossroads-bank defines] an "establishment unit" as "any place that is geographically identifiable by an address, where at least one activity of the entity is carried out".

The company profile page gives basic background details - name, status, corporate and establishment unit ID number, address, activities (including regulated activities). Directors are identified under the "functions" tab towards the bottom of the page, which also gives their date of appointment. Information on former directors is only available through National Gazette announcements, which also may provide additional identity information. Reverse directorship searches are not possible.

===Official Gazette===

* [https://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi/rech_res.pl Belgian Official Gazette] - Should contain announcements of all appointments/resignations of directors since 1 June 1997.

The publications in the National Gazette are categorised by the information declared, such as changes to company statutes, appointment of directors, and changes in ownership. These are frequently in Dutch, but sometimes French (use the Google Translate app camera function to translate).

===Ownership===

* [https://finance.belgium.be/en/E-services/register-beneficial-owners UBO registry] maintained by the Federal Public Service of Finance is accessible via a Belgian e-government ID and certain EU e-gov IDs (including AT, CZ, NL). '''However, since 2022 (still accurate as of March 2025), access to the registry has been suspended.'''

Ownership information is only available through official records by accessing and reading national gazette announcements, which will be categorised as such. If none are available, check the initial registration announcement. Where a company's initial shareholder(s) is an individual, the registration announcement will frequently give additional identification information on them, such as date of birth, address and marital status.

The national gazette announcements of private companies (BVs and SAs) may identify shareholders only partially, or not at all.

==Litigation==

Search by date, case number and keyword. However, names of defendants (natural and legal persons) are anonymised. (''pub'')
