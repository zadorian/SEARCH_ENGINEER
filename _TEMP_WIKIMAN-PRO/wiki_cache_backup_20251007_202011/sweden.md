==Corporate Registry==

[https://www.bolagsverket.se/ Bolagsverket]

The official corporate registry. The Swedish-language version of the website offers more options than the English one. The Bolagsverket, business register, provides information on companies, but only company name and ID number are available without registration. Registration costs €50, and gives the user access to corporate filings, which may be downloaded for a fee.
  
Company filings 
  
To purchase the filings: 

On Bolagsverket's website, click "Köpa registreringsbevis" 

Input the company's name or registration number  

You'll have the option to purchase some of the documents in English: 

"Certificate of registration" - standard company registry extract which includes basic registration information, address, directors, signatories, capital and name history (but not shareholders). 

"Current assignments" - lists roles the company has in other companies and organisations. 

"Uppgifter ur registret över verkliga huvudmän" - lists the UBOs of a company who hold a 25%+ stake. 

"Bolagsordning" - articles of association/statutes. 

"Protokoll" - meeting minutes (e.g. AGM, extraordinary meetings, board meetings, etc) 

"Årsredovisning" - annual (financial) reports. 

Tick off your choices and click "Lägg i kundvagn"

Click "Till kassan". Fill in your contact details.

Pay using a credit/debit card.

You'll receive an email with download links. 

You will find the shareholding information in the annual report, not in the company registry extract. 

A company's historical boards of directors are only accessible to Bolagsverket's registered clients with Swedish ID numbers. Get in touch with Eugen or any Sweden-based contrib for help. 

  
Directorship checks 

Swedish residents 

Every long-term Swedish resident has a personal 10-digit ID number (personnummer) which consists of its DOB (YYYYMMDD)+four digits, e.g. 851125-5477. You will need this number to run directorship checks in the official registry. 

To find out a person's ID, you can register for free e.g. with www.ratsit.se (a third party aggregator which sources its data directly from government databases) and search by person's name and DOB there. You will still need to have an idea of the person's age and/or location to eliminate namesakes. You can also call the tax authority (see Skatteverket).

[https://mrkoll.se Mrkoll] - This can be a quicker way of getting someone's ID number than the process outlined two rows above. It is a commercial aggregator of personal information. Will be best for the more rare names or if you already have the subject's address on file. Requires Swedish VPN.


UBO checks

It is mandatory for Swedish companies, trusts and other eligible organisations to report their UBOs (those who control at least 25% of votes or shares) to Bolagsverket. You will need a Swedish digital ID to login into and search the UBO register (get in touch with Eugen or any Sweden-based contrib). https://bolagsverket.se/sjalvservice/etjanster/verklighuvudman/sokverklighuvudman.3084.html
Short-term residents who stay in Sweden for less than 1 year or those who have moved abroad will not show up in the searches.

==Litigation==

The Swedish judiciary system consists of:			
			
48 district courts (tingsrätt),the Labour Court (Arbetsdomstolen, equivalent of the Labour Tribunal),administrative courts (förvaltningsdomstolar),environmental courts (mark- och miljödomstolar),migration courts (migrationsdomstolar),patent and market courts (patent- och marknadsdomstolar),the Svea Court of Appeal (Svea Hovrätt) andthe Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen). 


[https://www.lexbase.se/ Lexbase]
		
The quickest way to do litigation checks on individuals or companies in Sweden is via the commercial database www.lexbase.se/. You will need the subject's ID number (company reg. no. (organisationsnummer) or personal ID no, (personnummer)) or name and place of residence. Any findings can be purchased for a small fee.	
		
Note that Lexbase, while begin fairly comprehensive, may not always have all court filings digitised. If you know the case number and the parties, it is possible to get in touch with the relevant court directly to obtain case filings, anonymously if required. The filings are collected in person at the court location.

Other courts

Some other courts publish their decisions in online databases. If there are any that could be relevant on a case, check them out.


Enquiring with courts directly

You need to call most courts, particularly District and Appeals Courts. No Swedish necessary except to read any filings.
 
Step 1: Gather all the relevant current and historical addresses for your subject. Include branch/regional offices. For a person, perhaps best to call Skatteverket to get the old addresses.
 
Step 2: Find the courts you need to search by searching by postcode of the offices/addresses of your subject. Search all former addresses as well. Make a note of the email/phone number of each relevant District and Appeals Court and make a list of subjects you want to enquire about. Note: You need to enquire by organisation number or ID number, rather than company/subject name.
 
Step 3: Call each court one by one. When contacting them, always ask how far back the resources go – tends to be about five years for civil, a bit longer for criminal.
 
Step 4: If any cases are found, ask them for a quick summary of the case. If the lawsuit relates to something more serious, then it would make sense to request the filings. In such instances, emailing is fine.
 
It is also OK to email courts when doing secondary research e.g. researching a company that is not the target company or an individual who is not a subject.

Skatteverket – Swedish tax authority

Call: +46 77 156 75 67 https://skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglishengelska/contactus.4.4c5def2714bbf25766d2d6f.html
 
If you are looking at a Swedish national and do not have their ID number, call this registry to obtain it by providing the identifiers you have (the more the better. Full name, address, rough age help a lot). With it, you will be able to access information on many of the sources provided below. You can also find it through desktop research (see below), but may not be as efficient.
 
You can also get a working ID number if that person has never resided in Sweden, but for instance worked for a Swedish-based company. This is called a "samordningsnummer." The six first digits contains the date of birth, however, the digits for the day of birth will contain the number 6 (if single digit). For instance if the date of birth is 6 December 1985, the first six digits in the "samordningsnummer" will be 85 12 06.
Note: It is much more efficient to call them to get the samordningsnummber – may not be possible to retrieve through desktop research.
 
Note: You can also get information about current and former registered addresses; family status (single/married/divorced), number of children, parents' names; confirmation that a person has passed away.
 
 
No questions asked, all you need is the full name and DOB of the person. In many cases you may not even need both – if a rare name and you know their address or which city they live in, that could be enough.
 
ESG application: Skatteverket can also be called up to confirm the company's NACE codes (SNI in Sweden). Provide the company number and the operator will be able to provide you with the relevant SNI codes. For a historical record of the company's SNI codes you can try and call Statistiska centralbyrån at  +46 10-479 40 00.
