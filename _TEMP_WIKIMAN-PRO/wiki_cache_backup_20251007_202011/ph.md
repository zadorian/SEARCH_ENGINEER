==Corporate Registry==

In the Philippines, official records for corporations and partnerships can be obtained through the [https://www.sec.gov.ph/online-services/sec-express-system/ '''Securities and Exchange Commission's Express System'''] website. 

Official records for corporations and partnerships are available through the [https://www.sec.gov.ph/online-services/sec-express-system/ '''Securities and Exchange Commission's Express System'''] website. However, reverse directorship checks are not available in the Philippines.
For corporations and partnerships, you can order General information sheets which include information such as dates of incorporation, identities of directors and shareholders, subsidiaries, and contact information.

To identify a company's ownership, check all corporate filings bearing the "associates" description. These only present information on what was changed upon the announcement - note that this can be just a change to an individual shareholder's information (e.g. change of address). Previously-existing shareholdings omitted from a given filing will not have changed, and you will need to check previous (sometimes several) "associates" filings to identify other information.
If there are no "associates" filings, check the first "registration" filing, which will identify the company's owners upon incorporation.

These records can be paid for online using a credit card, but they cannot be viewed online. Instead, they are couriered to a physical address in the Philippines, which typically takes between 5-7 working days. Alternatively, you can schedule an appointment to pick them up in person at the SEC.

If you don't have someone in the Philippines who can receive, scan, and send these documents to you, you'll need to use a third-party provider.

For sole proprietorships, the only information you can check online is whether the business name has been registered. This can be done by starting the process of registering a new entity on the [https://bnrs.dti.gov.ph/ '''Department of Trade and Industry's Business Name Registration System'''] website.

==Litigation==

The Philippine judiciary has four levels: Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Regional Trial Courts, Municipal and Metropolitan Trial Courts. At equal rank with the Court of Appeals are the Court of Tax Appeals and the Sandiganbayan, which has jurisdiction over criminal and civil cases involving offences committed by public officers and employees (e.g. graft).

The [https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/ '''e-Library of the Supreme Court'''] has a searchable database of decisions and its resolutions and those of the Court of Appeals. You have to make an account to search (it's free). The Supreme Court database goes back to 1996 and is fairly comprehensive, albeit with some holes. The Court of Appeals database only has partial records from 2006, 2013, 2014 and 2015.

The [http://ca.judiciary.gov.ph/ '''website of the Court of Appeals'''] has a searchable database of its decisions and resolutions. It is unclear how comprehensive it is and how far it goes back, however.

The [http://cta.judiciary.gov.ph/ '''website of the Court of Tax Appeals'''] has a searchable, comprehensive and up-to-date database of its decisions. It is unclear how far it goes back, however.

The [http://sb.judiciary.gov.ph/ '''website of the Sandiganbayan'''] has a searchable, comprehensive and up-to-date database of its decisions and resolutions going back to 2003.

==Regulatory==

The [http://www.prc.gov.ph/services/?id=... '''Professional Regulation Commission'''] is where you can search by profession and first and last name to verify license details of individuals in the Philippines.

==Asset Registries==

There is no centralised or electronic database for Philippine property records. Titles can be ordered from the [https://www.lra.gov.ph/ '''Land Registration Authority's eSerbisyo Portal''']. However, they can only be sent to a physical address in the Philippines. You also need to know the title number and which office of the Registry of Deeds is closest to it. In-country support will therefore almost certainly be needed for any inquiry.

The [http://onlineservices.ipophil.gov.ph '''Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines'''] is the official website of the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines.

==Political==

==Media==

The Philippines has historically had one of the region's most liberal media environments, although the space for dissent has been progressively shrinking since Rodrigo Duterte became president in 2016. The main daily broadsheets often lean towards being pro-establishment (especially under Duterte), but online news outlets such as [https://www.rappler.com/ '''Rappler'''] tend to be much bolder in publishing stories critical of the political and economic elite.

==Miscellaneous== 

The Philippines is a densely populated archipelagic country of around 110 million people. Just over half of the population lives on Luzon, the country's largest island, and around a quarter live in the national capital Metro Manila and its surrounding urban sprawl in central Luzon. The Philippines was a Spanish colony for 350 years, and the Spanish influence is still seen in areas such of religion (more than 80% of the country is Catholic), cuisine and other bits and pieces of culture. However, the linguistic legacy is largely limited to loanwords; very few people still speak Spanish.
