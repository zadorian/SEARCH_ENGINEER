==Corporate Registry==

To access the official registry, follow these steps:

* Go to [https://www.companies.gov.cy/en/21-eservices/esearch-in-business-entity-s-registry here] (where you can read a general description of what the registry contains and how it works).
* Click on "e-search."
* Enter the company's name or registration number in the relevant field and click "Go."
* Click on the company's name.
* On this page, you can see the company's name, registration number, legal form, establishment date, directors, secretaries, and address.
* If you want other information (see below for details) and are prepared to pay €10 for it, click on "Study File" at the top of the webpage, then log in (create a free account if you don't already have one).
* Next, enter the company name or registration number again and click "search."
* Choose the company and click "More details."
* Tick the box next to "Study File," click submit, and follow the steps to pay €10.
* On the following screen, click "eSearch Basket" to see a list of documents you've bought. Note that you might need to log in again at this stage, using the "Login" button at the top right of the page.
* Download the document from the basket and be sure to keep it somewhere safe because it won't be available to download again indefinitely.

This €10 extract should include (at least for limited companies):
* Full shareholder list.
* Name, address, and citizenship of directors, secretaries, and shareholders.
* History of any changes to name, address, directors, secretaries, shareholders, and share capital.

There's also a third-party database at [https://i-cyprus.com/ i-Cyprus] (priv). I definitely wouldn't buy anything from it, as it seems to be more expensive than the official site, but it is useful because you can search it by directors' names, something the official site doesn't allow. Note that the names of people who aren't Cypriot or Greek citizens are usually written in Latin.

==Disclaimers==

Public records in Cyprus may not always be up to date or complete due to the decentralized nature of record-keeping and administrative delays. It is advisable to verify the information from multiple sources when conducting research or due diligence.

While some public records are freely accessible, others may require a fee or formal request. Access to detailed financial or ownership information often requires authorization or proof of legitimate interest.

Cypriot law includes protections for personal data, and some records may be anonymized or restricted from public access to protect individual privacy rights. Requests for personal or sensitive information may require justification or legal permission.
