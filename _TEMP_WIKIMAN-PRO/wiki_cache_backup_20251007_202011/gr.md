== Greece Overview == 



Greece is located in Southeastern Europe, at the meeting point of three seas: the Ionian Sea to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south and the Aegean Sea to the east. Greece is bordered to the North by Albania, North Macedonia and Bulgaria; and to the East by Turkey. Most of Greece's islands are found in the Aegean Sea, and are divided into seven groups (from north to south): the north-eastern Aegean Islands, the Sporades, the prefecture of Evia which lies to the East of Athens and the mainland peninsula, the islands of Argo-Saronic, the Cyclades (a group of 56 islands), the Dodecanese and Crete. Since 1975, Greece has been a parliamentary republic with a president as its head of state, elected for a five-year term. The role of the president has been largely ceremonial since the 1986 constitutional reform. The president and parliament, which has 300 deputies, have joint legislative power. The executive government is comprised of a cabinet which includes a prime minister and 22 ministers. In 1981 Greece entered the European Community. Traditionally the Greek economy has been shored up by the agricultural sector, but today the importance of agriculture is declining, and the services industry, mainly tourism, is Greece's biggest industry, with shipping second, accounting for 4.5 percent of GDP. The Greek-owned maritime fleet is the largest in the world, with 3,079 vessels accounting for 18 percent of the world's fleet capacity. The financial crisis of the late 2000s hit Greece particularly hard; high public spending and tax evasion, along with the credit crunch and the resulting recession, had left the country with a considerable debt burden. The economy is seen rebounding strongly in 2021, supported by reviving private and capital spending and incoming EU funding. 


Executive Branch 

The Cabinet of Greece, which is the main body of government, includes the heads of all executive ministries, appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister.  

·       President

·       Prime minister 

The prime minister is elected by the Parliament and he or she is usually the leader of the party controlling the absolute majority of MPs. If no party has the absolute majority, the president shall give the leader of the party with a relative majority (plurality) an exploratory mandate to ascertain the possibility of forming a government enjoying the confidence of parliament. According to the Constitution, the prime minister safeguards the unity of the government and directs its activities.

==Corporate Registry== 


[https://www.businessregistry.gr/publicity/index GEMI Public Records]

Greece's online corporate register, the GEMI was launched in 2011. Some companies are missing. It is searchable for any commercial disclosures  just one of the following pieces of information relating to the company: Tax Identification Number (A.F.M. - Greek abbreviation) or General Commercial Registry (Γ.Ε.ΜI.) number or company name or short name.

Corporate records in Greece can be accessed for free online, although they usually only go back a few years. They will usually disclose the directors or administrators of a company. Shareholders are sometimes listed in the accounts or articles of association but this is hit or miss. Financial statements are often provided. If you want to be sure you have all of the filings back as far as incorporation, you need to get someone to go to the registry and look through the physical file of the company.

You can only search by company, not by director or shareholder. Use Orbis and OpenCorporates for this or else a contributor (talk to CC). You can search by the company's name, but the best way to search is by using the 12-digit company number (Αρ. Γ.Ε.ΜΗ) or 9-digit tax number (ΑΦΜ). You can get these in Orbis or OpenCorporates. Click through into the company's profile to get to the filings which are listed at the bottom. If you can't find the company in the registry, try finding it in OpenCorporates and clicking through on the link it provides. Note: if you're searching for a Greek company in OpenCorporates, use uppercase Greek letters. The bottom line is that the registry's online search is a little unreliable so be careful about concluding that a company isn't registered there, is inactive or hasn't filed anything.

Legislative Branch

The Greek Parliament (Βουλή των Ελλήνων) has 300 members, elected for a four-year term by a system of reinforced proportional representation in 48 multi-seat constituencies, 8 single-seat constituencies and a single nationwide list.

Judicial Branch

In line with the principle of the separation of powers, justice is independent of the legislative and executive powers.

Types of courts

Courts in Greece are divided into Administrative, Civil and Criminal.

Administrative courts (Διοικητικά δικαστήρια)

Civil courts (Πολιτικά δικαστήρια)

Criminal courts (Ποινικά δικαστήρια)

Court martial (στρατοδικείο), naval court (ναυτοδικείο) and air force court (αεροδικείο)

Supreme Special Court (Ανώτατο Ειδικό Δικαστήριο)

Special court for corruption lawsuits

Special court for liability of Ministers

Special court for disputes on remuneration of judicial officials

Disputes of an administrative nature are under the jurisdiction of the Council of State (Symboulio tis Epikrateias) and the Regular Administrative Courts (courts of First Instance and Courts of Appeal).

Disputes of civil nature and voluntary jurisdiction are under the jurisdiction Civil Courts.

The punishment of crimes and the adoption of all measures required by the criminal laws are under the jurisdiction of Criminal Courts.

The Court of Cassation (Areios Pagos) is the Supreme Court for Civil and Criminal Law. It examines only legal and not factual issues and it is the highest degree of judicial resort.

The auditing of public spending, the control of contracts of a significant economic value where one of the contractors is the State, the audit of the finances of public persons, the submission of reports to Parliament for the statement of accounts and balance sheets of the State are all under the jurisdiction of the Court of Auditors (Elegktiko Synedrio).

The adjudication of objections at the validity of national parliamentary elections, referendums and the resolution of conflicting jurisprudence between courts and administrative commissions or between the Council of State and Regular Administrative Courts, or Civil and Criminal Courts, or between the Court of Auditors and other Courts is under the jurisdiction of the Special Highest Court (Anotato Eidiko Dikastirio).

Another organ of quasi-judicial nature is the Legal Council of State (Nomiko Symboulio tou Kratous). According to article 100A of the Constitution, the Legal Council of the State is assigned with the judicial support and representation of the State and to the recognition of claims against it or to the settlement of disputes with the State.

Administrative Divisions

Greece is divided into 13 administrative regions which are further divided into 74 regional units. The 13 administrative regions (Περιφέρειες, Periféries) are each headed by a popularly elected governor (Περιφερειάρχης, Periferiárhis) and presided over by the popularly elected regional council (Περιφερειακό Συμβούλιο, Periferiakó Simvoúlio). Each of the 74 regional units (Περιφερειακές Ενότητες, Periferiakés Enóti̱tes) are headed by a vice governor (Αντιπεριφερειάρχης, Antiperiferiárhis), who is taken from the same political party as the elected governor. The 13 regions are mostly political and geographically. Greece is home to nine regions: Thrace, with the capital Alexandroupolis, Macedonia, with the capital of Thessaloniki; Epirus; Central Greece; Pelloponese; the Ionian Islands; the Aegean islands; Crete; and Athens.

Greece's 74 regional units are divided into 325 municipalities (Δήμοι, Dhími) which are led by a popularly elected mayor (Δήμαρχος, Dhímarhos) and municipal council (Δημοτικό Συμβούλιο, Dhimotikó Simvoúlio). Each municipality is divided into small municipal units (Δημοτικές Ενότητες, Dhimotikés Enótites) which in turn contain municipal communities (relatively urban communities) and local communities (relatively rural communities). Municipal councils select community members to serve on more local town hall councils which focus on local needs in the municipality's communities and give local feedback to the municipal government.


Litigation records aren't easily accessible in Greece so you will likely need a contributor for this research.

Justis VLex contains very limited filings from certain Greek courts, mostly from before 2000 so not very helpful.
