==Corporate Registry==

Various sources of corporate records are available in Morocco.

===National Enterprise Register===

'''[Link to the relevant source]'''

Morocco's National Enterprise Register is managed at the national level by the relevant government body. The search engine supports searches by company name, number, and other characteristics. Company pages on the Enterprise Register give basic information, including those listed below. Directors, other principals, and UBOs (where disclosed as required) are identified, with the DOBs of directors and UBOs given.

* Name
* Corporate ID
* Activity
* Entity type
* Share capital
* Wholly-owned (Y/N)
* Branch registrations
* Date of registration with its current commercial court

Note: The company's date of ''registration'' may not be its date of ''incorporation''. Look for a date of activity commencement or historical filings to check.

===Commercial Court Registry Database===

'''[Link to the relevant source]'''

The older corporate database, maintained by the Commercial Court Registries. Compared to the National Enterprise Register, this database may only offer corporate filings for a fee. However, it does offer various company details for free, including those listed below. Directors and other principals are listed.

* Address
* Trade name
* Legal form
* Last year's turnover (where declared)
* Activity
* Branch registrations
* Date of registration at the current Commercial Court

Further detailed documents may be obtained for a fee. The most useful of these are individual filings and annual accounts.

===Commercial Gazette Records===

'''[Link to the relevant source]'''

The Official Bulletin of Announcements regularly publishes announcements that companies are required to make on changes made. It may be searched by company name or ID, and also by keyword, which can identify directors.

===Free Corporate Filings===

'''[Link to the relevant source]'''

This database provides basic identity data on companies and, if available, a table presenting details from their most recent accounts. Further down the company page, a list of the company's corporate announcements is given. Beyond the corporate announcements, the database lists the company's corporate filings and makes them available for free download.

===Associations and Foundations===

'''[Link to the relevant source]'''

The Official Journal publishes announcements by associations and foundations (charities).

===Note on Identifying Ownership===

Ownership identification can be complex in Morocco. Always check a public company's accounts first to save time.

Moroccan companies declare changes in ownership in individual filings to the corporate registries. These filings are available through the '''National Enterprise Register''', '''Commercial Court Registry Database''' (for a fee), and '''Free Corporate Filings''' (overall best option). Scrolling down the list of filings, look for ones described as a change to share capital. Typically, these will consist of notes on a company shareholder meeting detailing the change, and then updated company statutes.

===Directorships===

Directorship searches are available through all of the official corporate records sources listed above, namely:

* '''[Link to the relevant source]''' - search by name, surname, and birthdate through the Advanced Search
* '''[Link to the relevant source]''' - search by name, surname through the Advanced Search
* '''[Link to the relevant source]''' - search director's "[surname, name]" as a keyword
* '''[Link to the relevant source]''' - Provides a surname/name search for directors and sole partnerships.

Note that while a register of disqualified directors exists in Morocco, it is not publicly accessible.

==Media==

Media searches on Google generally produce the majority of the adverse or noteworthy findings about Moroccan subjects. High-profile subjects will have a solid English language media footprint in Nexis as well.

'''[https://www.google.com/ Google]'''

A search of Google Noticias is a good place to start scoping a Moroccan subject. Follow with routine Google DWS searches in both French and Arabic. Targeted google site searches of the Moroccan Government Portal and the Moroccan web domain are also extremely useful for identifying adverse and noteworthy information.

'''[https://www.nexis.com/ Nexis]'''

Nexis works best for higher-profile subjects but is still required for low and medium profile subjects.

'''[https://sourceafrica.net/ sourceAFRICA]'''

This is a platform where African NGOs and newspapers share source documents in the public domain. Contributing organisations include the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting or the South African newspaper Mail & Guardian. Currently they host more than 5000 documents.
