==Access to Official / Government Websites==

A range of Russian government-affiliated websites are currently inaccessible from various Western jurisdictions. These may be accessed using VPN connected to such "close" jurisdictions as Serbia, UAE, Georgia, Israel, etc. (examples from jurisdictions offered by Nord VPN). Official websites may also be inaccessible, jammed or slow to operate due to cyber activity.

On the other hand, some government websites seem not to work when you're using a VPN (regardless of country) but work fine without one. So be sure to try that if no VPN works!

==Corporate Registry== 

Russia's corporate registry, the Single State Registry of Legal Persons, may be accessed directly in a number of ways, with a search function available on the Federal Tax Service [https://egrul.nalog.ru/index.html '''website''']. Search by name, corporate ID ("OGRN") or tax ID ("INN"). The search results will deliver company IDs, status, address, and dates of registration ("OGRN assignment date") and termination as relevant, and offers a pdf download of a current extract in Russian only ''(see sources below if you need to machine translate)'' . Current extracts offer various details, all of which are accompanied by the date on which the detail was registered, i.e. last changed, with only current information displayed. Note that the current corporate registry system became active in July 2002, with extracts for companies established before then including a creation date.

The same Tax Service search engine can also identify sole traders ("individual entrepreneurs") by their name and tax number. For individual subjects, this search can deliver useful ID information such as tax number, associated address, and citizenship.

[http://russianpartner.biz/ '''Enquiry Service of Legal Entities''']

A commercial database with the ability to purchase official information for a company, some extra details and financial metrics.

[http://www.ffms.ru/hd_base/co_schema/ '''Federal Service for Financial Market''']

A list of financial companies (mostly banks) with their beneficiaries.

[http://egrul.nalog.ru/ '''Federal Tax Authority''']

State database of companies, which provides the ability to search for any business in Russia by the company name, INN or OGRN.

Note that the aforementioned ID numbers are of more use for research on Russian companies than for those from other European jurisdictions, due to a marked (Soviet?) lack of imagination in company naming. Tax IDs will frequently be featured on company websites, usually either at the bottom of the homepage, or on a "contact" page. Company names also frequently include a set of words or initials categorizing the company's activity followed by a company name, always indicated in speech marks. Activity categories (initials) should not be confused with entity types, which are as follows:

*Limited liability company (OOO or LLC) (Russian: Общество с ограниченной ответственностью, OOO)
*Sole proprietor or "individual entrepreneur" (IP) (Russian: Индивидуальный предприниматель, ИП)
*Joint-stock company (AO or JSC) (Russian: Aкционерное общество, АО) '''Note:''' ''such entities' ownership will not be displayed in official corporate records, but may be available on company websites/in annual reports''
*Public joint-stock company (PAO or PJSC) (Russian: Публичное акционерное общество, ПАО)
*Non-public joint-stock company (NAO or NPJSC) (Russian: Непубличное акционерное общество, НАО)
''Joint-stock companies registered before a 2014 change in legislation are frequently still officially registered as:''
*Private/Closed joint-stock company (ZAO or PJSC) (Russian: Закрытое акционерное общество, ЗАО) or
*Open joint-stock company (OAO or JSC) (Russian: Открытое акционерное общество, ОАО)

===Transparent Business===

The Federal Tax Service maintains the "Transparent Business" website, with a search function which displays the same information as the corporate registry proper (in machine-translatable format). Additional information is also sometimes available, such as information on tax or other debts, amount of tax paid, and number of employees. A company's page will also include a link to its page on the accounting records database, if available.

Transparent Business also offers a reverse affiliation search, which functions for both legal and natural persons, (select the "participation in legal entities" search tab) and an address search ("legal address"; useful for identifying possible affiliates), alongside searches for disqualified directors ("disqualifications") and a similar regulatory sanction against business owners ("restrictions on participation in a legal entity").

===Private Services===

While a lot of key information is available from the official services described above, they omit historic information. This is often available through a range of third-party services.

[https://spark-interfax.ru/en '''Spark Interfax''']

Local gold standard, providing a wide range of registration, accounting and legal information and convenient navigation, but at a corresponding price.

===Financial Information===

The Federal Tax Service maintains a [https://bo.nalog.ru/ '''database'''] of data harvested from accounts submitted by certain companies. It is quite new, so displays information only from recent years. Data quality varies due to its self-submitted nature.

==Litigation==

A range of official litigation sources are available. If your subject is a corporate entity, consider the third-party corporate records providers listed above. Individual parties to cases are usually, but not always, identified in the format (Surname) (First name initial) (Patronymic initial). They may also be identified by their tax number.

[http://fssprus.ru/ '''Federal Service of Court Bailiffs''']

A database of Russian citizens who have any court debts. Searchable by name.

'''Official database'''

The official [https://sudrf.ru/index.php?id=300&searchtype=sp '''Pravosudie'''] litigation database presents records from the Constitutional Court, federal and regional-level Courts of Arbitration, federal and regional-level general jurisdiction courts and selected magistrates courts, dating back to 1999. Records on criminal, civil and administrative cases are available.

The [https://ras.arbitr.ru/ '''Arbitr'''] database provides access to nation-wide arbitration cases. Official web-site of Russian Arbitrage. Provides the ability to search by the name (of person or a company) and gives access to decisions and documents.

'''Court Websites'''

The federal-level [https://vsrf.ru/lk/practice/acts '''High Court'''] publishes decisions on its website.

While various databases provide access to rulings from a range of (regional) general courts and (local) magistrates courts, it is worth checking whether specific local courts relevant to the subject (particularly individuals) publish records online. Single websites for magistrates courts in [https://mos-sud.ru/search '''Moscow'''] (dating back to 2010) and [https://mirsud.spb.ru/ '''Saint Petersburg'''] are available, and Moscow also maintains a [https://mos-gorsud.ru/ '''database'''] of general jurisdiction rulings. For others, identify relevant local courts based on address history and through [https://sudact.ru/regular/area/ this] third-party list of courts, then navigate to the relevant court websites to search for rulings.

'''Third-party databases'''

The [https://sudact.ru/ '''SudAct'''] database presents a collection of rulings from the High Court, Courts of Arbitration, general courts and magistrates courts, and claims to cover all Russian courts. Records on criminal, civil and administrative cases are available. It is also searchable through an external site search, which is useful for specifying subject names using boolean operators - note, however, that Russian grammatical rules can vary the spelling of most surnames, so a specific search may not find all results. A web-site that collects different court cases and provides documents. Available only with Russian IP.

A third-party database aggregating rulings from Russia's [https://xn--90afdbaav0bd1afy6eub5d.xn--p1ai/ '''courts of general jurisdiction'''] is available, but the site was functioning intermittently as of January 2024. This database appears similar to the [http://www.gcourts.ru/ GCourts] database, which has run afoul of the data privacy regulator in the past and was offline as of January 2024.

The market-leading [https://www.consultant.ru/about/software/cons/specpoisk_sudpraktiki/ '''Konsultant'''] and [https://www.garant.ru/ '''Garant'''] legal databases offer comprehensive access to legal records, but are priced accordingly.

The [https://sudrf.cntd.ru/ '''Kodeks'''] database provides limited searches of its database of records from regional arbitration and general courts to unregistered users.

===Criminal Searches===

Access to criminal records is restricted, although individuals may request criminal record checks on themselves for official purposes. 

The Ministry of Internal Affairs maintains a [https://xn--b1aew.xn--p1ai/wanted '''database'''] of wanted persons on its website. In order to avoid providing an email address to get results, run a site search of subject's name (format: Surname-Name-Patronymic).

If an individual subject is a known prisoner, additional information on them may be available in a database of incarcerated individuals on the relevant institution's website, although not all penitentiaries maintain such databases. The NGO Sova maintains a [https://www.sova-center.ru/database/ '''database'''] of incarcerated individuals.

The Federal Service for Financial Monitoring maintains a [https://fedsfm.ru/documents/terrorists-catalog-portal-act '''database'''] of individuals and organisations recognised as terrorists or extremists by the Russian government. Note that the latter category is frequently imposed on political opponents of the current government.
