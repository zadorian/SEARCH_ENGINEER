## 2025-12-04 - Claude (Opus 4.5) - Documentation Session

**Duration:** Part of larger session
**Context:** Consolidating module documentation

**Completed:**
- Created `1_CONCEPT.md` with Global vs Jurisdictional paradigm
- Created `2_TODO.md` with outstanding tasks
- Created `3_LOGS.md` (this file)
- Documented the fundamental distinction between search modes
- Mapped API status by jurisdiction

**Key Findings:**
- Two distinct paradigms: Global (discovery) vs Jurisdictional (precision)
- UK has most complete API coverage
- Matrix holds 137 jurisdictions worth of knowledge
- Dynamic button generation from Matrix not yet fully implemented

**Paradigm Summary:**
| Mode | Input | Sources | Automation |
|------|-------|---------|------------|
| Global | Name only | OpenCorporates, OpenSanctions | Full |
| Jurisdictional | Name + Country | country_engines, Matrix, APIs | Varies |

**Next Steps:**
- Expand country_engines beyond UK
- Implement dynamic button generation from Matrix
- See `2_TODO.md` for full task list
