        "wiki_content": "===Firmenbuch===\n\n* [https://www.firmenbuch.at/ Company Register Austria (Firmenbuch)] for searching Commercial Registers and Companies (''pub'')\n\n* [http://www.firmenabc.at Firmenabc] - A quick and free solution for company information, though not always 100% up to date (''pub'')\n\nThe Austrian National Enterprise Register, known as the Firmenbuch, is accessible online. It provides comprehensive data on all registered companies in Austria, including company name, legal form, registration number, and details on directors and shareholders. The search engine supports queries by company name, registration number, and director name.\n\nFor Austrian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the corporate registry (Firmenbuch) historically provided access to various corporate information. This included details about board members, financial statements, and ownership structures, essential for conducting detailed corporate research. The change in regulation post-R\u00c4G 2014 reduced the amount of disclosed information for smaller entities. Medium and large companies are still subject to more comprehensive disclosure requirements. They must publicly disclose their financial reports and subsidiaries, adhering to stricter transparency regulations. This ensures that larger entities remain accountable and transparent regarding their corporate governance and financial status.\n\nPrior to the Rechnungslegungs\u00e4nderungsgesetz 2014 (R\u00c4G 2014) that came into effect in 2016, even small companies (those not classified as mittelgro\u00dfe or gro\u00dfe under Austrian law) were required to publicly disclose their subsidiaries. This regulation changed, and small companies were no longer obligated to publicly disclose their subsidiaries, impacting transparency regarding ownership and corporate structure post-2016. This means corporate structures are sometimes available in archived corporate records from before then even for these entities!\n\n====Privatstiftung====\n\nPrivatstiftungen are private foundations established under Austrian law, primarily used for asset management, estate planning, and sometimes charitable purposes. These entities often own assets indirectly through subsidiaries and do not typically disclose financial statements or returns publicly. This structure provides a level of financial opacity, allowing ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) to maintain a degree of anonymity and privacy in their financial dealings.\n\nAustrian Privatstiftungen can have complex structures, often involving international holdings. These foundations may have wholly-owned subsidiaries in various countries, with significant investments in properties and other assets. The names of the board members of the Privatstiftung are publicly available, but the beneficiaries and specific financial details are usually not disclosed in Austrian records, adding another layer of confidentiality.\n\n===Commercial Court Registry Database===\n\n* [https://www.justiz.gv.at/ Commercial Court Database] - maintained by the Austrian judiciary, provides access to detailed company filings for a fee. Available documents include KBIS Extracts, which provide detailed company information such as full names and addresses of directors, and historical filings including changes in share capital and ownership.

        "wiki_content": "===Moneyhouse===\n\nMoneyhouse.ch is a private third-party corporate record aggregator, and it's usually the most convenient place to start looking at corporate records. We have an account, and when logged in some extra information should be visible, so it's best to do that. \n\nThis website has a simple search function where you can enter the name of a company or an individual, and it'll search all Swiss cantons plus Liechtenstein. If you enter an individual's name, it'll show you directorships but not ownership. \n\nThe page for a company shows a decent amount of information, though not arranged in the most user-friendly way. \n\n* In the first section (\"\u00dcbersicht\" in German), you can see its share capital, number of employees, address, sector of business, directors' names, incorporation date and purpose (often quite a detailed and specific description), then there's the most recent corporate filing that names them (from the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce, \"SHAB\").\n* The second section (\"Ausk\u00fcnfte\") allows you to buy various types of financial report.\n* The third section (\"Management\") shows you current and past directors, and their dates.\n* The fourth section (\"Netzwerk\") visually displays directorships and doesn't seem very useful.\n* The fifth section (\"Timeline\") shows major events on a timeline.\n* The sixth section (\"Kennzahlen\") shows some basic information already included in the first section.\n* The seventh section (\"Besitzverh\u00e4ltnisse\") should in theory list the company's shareholders and shareholdings/subsidiaries, but in practice it's very often empty/incomplete.\n* The eighth section (\"Meldungen\") lists SHAB filings.\n* The ninth section (\"Marken\") lists brands registered with the company.\n\nThe page for an individual shows more limited information: \n* The first section (\"\u00dcbersicht\") only really shows their citizenship (or for Swiss citizens, canton of origin) and place of residence (town if in Switzerland, town and country if abroad) and then provides the most recent corporate filing that mentions them.\n* The second tab (\"Ausk\u00fcnfte\") allows you to download a PDF containing the information from the first, third and fifth tabs.\n* The third tab (\"Mandate\") shows a list of past and present directorships and their dates.\n* The fourth tab (\"Netzwerk\") visualizes their connections and doesn't seem particularly useful.\n* The fifth tab (\"Beteiligungen\") should in theory show companies in which they own shares, but in practice it's usually empty.\n* The sixth tab (\"Meldungen\") provides a list of corporate filings that mention them.\n\nAs Moneyhouse is a third-party website, we don't usually cite it directly in our reports. To cite, we can either provide a link to an official website (see below) or just write something like \"Swiss corporate records\".\n\n* [http://www.moneyhouse.ch/ Online company database with director] names, shareholders, gazette notifications and registered company activity (''pub'', ''paid'')\n\n===Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce (SHAB)===\n\nThe Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce, generally known by its German acronym SHAB, has an official website at shab.ch. Its local names are Schweizerisches Handelsamtsblatt (German), Feuille officielle suisse du commerce (French) and Foglio ufficiale svizzero di commercio (Italian).\n\nThe SHAB contains entries for certain types of changes to corporate records, such as the establishment or dissolution of a company, the addition or removal of directors, and changes of company names. There are two search fields on the website's homepage, one for all entries since 2 September 2018 and one for all entries before that, back until 1999. \n\nIt's worth searching this website if the information on Moneyhouse seems questionable or incomplete, which may especially be the case when a company has changed name or address. \n\n* [https://www.shab.ch/shabforms/COMMON/application/applicationGrid.jsp?newLanguage=EN Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce] - Information about company changes and gazette notifications (''pub'')\n\n===Official cantonal corporate registries===\n\nEach Swiss canton has its own corporate registry, and although Moneyhouse generally does a good job of aggregating data from all of them, it's often a good idea to check the relevant official registry too, to be certain of up-to-date information. In some cases, the official registry may contain information that Moneyhouse lacks. As these registries are official, if they let you link directly to companies' pages, you can use these links as citations in your reports.\n\nHere are the cantonal registries:\n* Aargau https://ag.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Appenzell Inner-Rhodes https://ai.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Appenzell Outer-Rhodes https://ar.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Basel City https://bs.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Basel-Landschaft https://bl.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml \n* Bern https://be.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Fribourg https://adm.appls.fr.ch/hrcmatic/\n* Geneva https://app2.ge.ch/ecohrcinternet/ \n* Glarus https://gl.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Grisons https://gr.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Jura https://ju.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Lucerne https://lu.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Neuch\u00e2tel https://www.ne.ch/autorites/DESC/NECO/rcne/Pages/Recherche-d'entreprises.aspx\n* Nidwalden https://nw.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Obwalden https://ow.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Schaffhausen https://sh.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Schwyz https://sz.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Solothurn https://so.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* St. Gallen https://sg.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Thurgau https://tg.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Ticino https://ti.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Uri https://ur.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Valais https://vs.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Vaud https://prestations.vd.ch/pub/101266/\n* Zug https://zg.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Zurich https://zh.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n\n* [http://www.zefix.ch/ Central Business Names Index -] Official central Registry for all cantonal commercial registers in the Swiss Confederation (''pub'')\n\n* [http://www.monetas.ch/ Free database for companies and] persons with visualization of connections (''pub'', ''reg'')\n\n* [https://www.berne-x.com Berne Exchange - Stock exchange] for small and medium-sized enterprises (''pub'')\n\n* [http://www.six-swiss-exchange.com Six Swiss Exchange - Switzerland's] principal stock exchange with significant shareholders information (''pub'')\n\n* [https://www.sihk.ch/ Swiss Chambers of Commerce -] Members Search Engine with over 14,000 companies (''pub'')\n\n* [http://www.swissyello.com Switzerland Business Directory - Online] unofficial business directory (''pub'')",

For any terms not in the glossary, conduct google research to identify the definition or reach out to another member of the LatAm team for help.\n\nBefore starting litigation searches, also refer to the Chile Litigation Guidance below.\n\nLegal System Overview\n\nThe legal system of Chile is complex and comprises more than 450 individual courts. At the top of Chile's judicial structure is the Supreme Court which exercises superintendence of all administrative courts in Chile as well as other more specialized courts including Free Competition Defense Court, the Public Procurement Court, the Environmental Courts, the Industrial Property Court and the Local Police Courts.\n\nCourts for the administration of justice are located throughout the country, divided among 17 jurisdictional territories of Chile, each of which is headed by its own respective court of appeals. These courts are located in the cities of Arica, Iquique, Antofagasta, Copiap\u00f3, La Serena, Valpara\u00edso, Santiago, San Miguel, Rancagua, Talca, Chill\u00e1n, Concepci\u00f3n, Temuco, Valdivia, Puerto Montt, Coyhaique and Punta Arenas.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned courts, there are other courts including those of mixed jurisdictions, civil courts, guarantee courts, oral criminal trial courts, family courts, labor letter courts, and labor and pension collection courts which are located both in the cities that are the seat of the Court of Appeals, as well as in the provincial capitals and in the communes or groups of communes.\n\nChile Judiciary Database\n\nThe Chile Judiciary Database contains a search that can be used to search all of the courts included in the Chile Judiciary, broken up into the following categories:\n\n- Supreme Court\n\n- Appellate Courts\n\n- Civil\n\n- Labor \n\n- Penal\n\nFor this category: You have to search by specific tribunal and year. In order to narrow, please search based on the tribunal which has jurisdiction on the comuna associated with your subject's address history (use the one generated by the Rutificator if you have no address info) and the comuna of the HQ of the subject company (if applicable). Consult the following [https://www.leychile.cl/Consulta/m/norma_plana?idNorma=25563&org=cdr link] to find the appropriate tribunal which has jurisdiction over the applicable comuna.\n\nCollection\n\nFamily\n\nSeparate searches should be conducted for each of the aforementioned categories. Searches should be conducted by RUN/RUT if we have that information. If not, then searches can be conducted by the subject's name.\n\nLink for the main search of the Chile Judiciary Database: https://oficinajudicialvirtual.pjud.cl/indexN.php\n\nA site search should also be conducted for all subjects on the main judiciary website: https://www.pjud.cl\n\n[https://www.tribunalconstitucional.cl/expedientes Constitutional Court]\n\nConduct internal and site searches of the constitutional court of Chile for all subjects which, as the name suggests, deals with matters pertaining to Chile's constitution.\n\nGeneral Note about Litigation Searches in Chile\n\nWhile they are functional, we can usually conduct fairly comprehensive litigation searches in Chile with relative ease as compared to other LatAm countries. However, the Chile litigation searches have a history of being unreliable and frequently go down. If you are unable to access the court searches with the Oficina Judicial link provided in the Chile Judiciary Database section, please try this link www.pjud.cl and navigate to the section marked \"consulta unificada de causas.\" Search all courts available and follow the above directions.\nIf this does not work, then please get in touch with your PM and the LatAm regional lead as you will need to contact IT for permission to use SILO to conduct these searches.\n\nLitigation Guidance\n\nPlease ask IT for access to Silo, this website is need to access the main Chilean litigation search.\nCourt records are usually accessible to the public. This means that the court documents are quite extensive and you will be able to get a lot of details and information from the court websites. We are working on getting the website to work on Exiger computers, however, this is a work in progress.\nThe Chilean judicial system is divided into three levels: Supreme Court, Courts of Appeals and courts of the first instance, which include trial courts, guarantee courts, and criminal oral trial courts.\n\nAt the top of the judiciary courts there is a Supreme Court (La Cort\u00e9 Suprema de Justicia de Chile). The Supreme Court has the administrative and regulatory control of all judges. Supreme court judges are refered to as Ministros.\n\nThere are 13 courts of appeals and many lower level courts divided into 16 regions and further divided into civil and criminal matters, children and labor.\nThere are also judges in taxation matters at the lower level, but they are not independent.\n\nConstitutional Court (\"Tribunal Constitucional\")\n\nThis court is in charge of the constitutional review of the laws. This authority must declare a law or an act with the force of law inapplicable or unconstitutional. In the first case, the norm ceases to have effect but only in the specific case where is declared. In the second case, the norm ceases to have effect in general terms.\nIt is unlikely you will have many findings from this court.\n\nMinisterio Publico (Public Prosecutor's Office)\n\nDirects investigations into crimes, it does not take the place of a court, no one will file a case with the MP. The MP accompanies cases, runs investigations, and sometimes makes decisions that should be filed with the appropriate court. One may file a complaint to have the MP investigate t a possible crime but, if evidence is identified this person will go to a \"Guarentee Court\"\n\n[http://www.fiscaliadechile.cl/Fiscalia/index.do Public Prosecutor's Office]\n\nIndependent public agency responsible for enforcing all criminal offenses.

There are also regional courts (tribunaux de grande instance) that have territorial jurisdiction in their respective departments that, like the lower level Courts of First Instance, try civil cases where claims do not exceed CFA 500,000 cases, only they also also try crimes. Courts of Appeal hear cases from either Courts of First Instance or Regional Courts.\n\nSupreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court (Cour supr\u00eame) is the highest level of court in Cameroon and is independent of the executive and legislative branches of government, subject to oversight only from the Higher Judicial Council. There are three chambers of the Supreme Court: the judicial chamber, which rules on standard cases appealed from lower courts pertaining to civil, criminal, and social matters; the administrative chamber, which rules on state affairs (e.g. election disputes); and the audit chamber, which rules on cases pertaining to public accounts and semi-private entities. The Supreme Court is subordinate to the executive branch's Ministry of Justice.\n\nConstitutional Council\n\nThe Constitutional Council (Conseil constitutionnel) interprets the Constitution and evaluates the constitutionality of laws and decrees. There are 11 members of the Constitutional Council that are appointed by the president for single, nine-year terms.\n\nHigh Court of Justice\n\nThe High Court of Justice (Haute cour de justice) has the jurisdiction to try the president and senior ranking government officials for high treason or conspiracy against national security. There are 15 members of the High Court of Justice \u2013 nine judges and six substitute judges \u2013 that are appointed by the National Assembly.\n\nOther Courts\n\nThe State Security Court hears cases pertaining to matters of internal and external state security. There are also military courts (tribunaux mlitaires).",

Such types of Czech companies must be formed with a minimum investment of CZK 1. A minimum of one stockholder and one director are essential for forming a limited liability company in the Czech Republic. The stockholders may be either natural persons or corporations. An SRO\u2019s stockholders assume limited responsibility for the organization, meaning they are not personally liable for the various monetary loans or liabilities of the corporation.\n\n'''Limited Partnership (k.s.)'''\n\nIn a limited partnership, the general partners are fully responsible for the monetary debts and responsibilities associated with the firm. The general partner is in charge of running the business in such types of companies in the Czech Republic. Limited partners have restricted liability and as such, they are only responsible for the value of funds they have contributed to the partnership, as specified in the articles of association of the firm.\n\n'''General Partnership (v.o.s.)'''\n\nA General Partnership is one of the types of business in the Czech Republic where two or more individuals jointly control and run the business that is operating under a single trade name. Partners in such businesses split their earnings and expenses equally. Every member is entirely accountable for the financial commitments and responsibilities of the partnership company. As such, each of the members in such types of Czech companies is equally and jointly liable for the monetary obligations and responsibilities of the firm. There isn\u2019t any basic investment requirement for forming such types of companies in the Czech Republic.\n\n'''Joint Stock Company (a.s.)'''\n\nA JSC\u2019s stockholders have restricted responsibility, which implies that if the business accrues difficulties or obligations, their finances are not in danger. As such, the stockholders of an AS are only financially responsible for their investment\u2019s value. Such types of companies in the Czech Republic must have CZK 2,000,000 as the required capital in order to be formed.\n\nThis sort of corporation may be established by at least one stakeholder. The statutory authority for corporations with multiple shareholders is the board of directors, which must have at least 3 persons. A supervisory board of a minimum of 3 people is also required to be established by the joint stock corporation. The three people on the supervisory boards cannot also serve as directors of the corporation in the case of an AS firm.\n\n'''Cooperative (Dru\u017estvo)'''\n\nA cooperative, known as a \u201cdru\u017estvo,\u201d is a business that is held and operated by the individuals who consume its commodities and services. The cooperative\u2019s main commercial objective is the societal or economical well-being of its participants, who are not individually accountable for the debts as well as liabilities of the enterprise. There isn\u2019t any capital necessity for establishing a cooperative, however, it must possess adequate funds to operate. Such types of companies in the Czech Republic must consist of three individuals as a minimum before they may be founded.\n\n'''Sole Proprietorship'''\n\nSuch types of business in the Czech Republic are controlled and managed by a sole person and can be established quickly and easily. In this kind of company entity, a single person operates their own firm on a self-employed basis. According to the Trade License Act, an individual can officially begin their business as a sole proprietor after they turn 18 years old. There isn\u2019t any legal distinction between the company\u2019s financial resources and those of the proprietor in these types of Czech businesses. As such, the firm proprietor is entirely and solely accountable for all financial debts and responsibilities of the firms.\n\n'''Branch Office'''\n\nA branch office in the Czech Republic is an addition to an international business that conducts business in the nation. A branch office in the Czech Republic isn\u2019t regarded as a separate legal organization, thus, the parent firm must authorize all of its business-related decisions. Also, in such types of Czech companies, the parent firm is responsible for the duties and actions of its branch. The Czech legislation governs its formation and inclusion in the Czech commercial registry. International corporations who want to maintain a presence in the Czech Republic without establishing a distinct legal organization might consider opening a branch office there. It enables the parent business to keep oversight of the Branch office\u2019s activities. \n\n'''Representative Office'''\n\nA representative office can be established in the Czech Republic by international corporations. A representative office is only permitted to carry out market research or advertise the products and services of its holding organization. Such types of business in the Czech Republic are not permitted to go on trade or enter into agreements.</div>\n</div>",

        "wiki_content": "===General Company Information (incl. ownership)===\n\nThe first site to check for German companies is [https://companyhouse.de]. Sastre has an account on this site, and logging in makes some small improvements to what you can see. This website's layout is easily navigable, so it's good to check for a general overview. However, it's not 100 % reliable\u2014especially for historical information (including establishment date)\u2014so any information to be cited in a report should ideally be verified at [https://www.unternehmensregister.de] (see below). Moreover, companyhouse.de tries to charge extra for certain information, such as shareholder details, which can be obtained for free from unternehmensregister.de. **Never buy any filings from companyhouse.de**, because the same documents can all be obtained for free from unternehmensregister.de.\n\n[https://www.unternehmensregister.de] is very tedious to use, but it has lots of great information, all for free. Here's a step\u2011by\u2011step guide to using it for general corporate information (including ownership):\n\n* In the \"Schnellsuche\" field on the homepage, enter the name of the company you want.\n* In the results page, scroll to find the right company and click on **\"Registerinformationen des Registergerichts\"** next to its name. Note that sometimes the company you want doesn't appear at the top of the results, even if you entered the exact name, so be careful not to accidentally choose the wrong company.\n* On the following page, click **\"Registerinformationen anzeigen.\"**\n* On the next page, click **\"AD\"** for a summary of the company's current details (\"AD\" stands for *aktueller Abdruck*, i.e. \"current extract\"). For companies with names ending in \"KG,\" this will include ownership information. For other companies, it won't.\n* Instead of \"AD,\" you can also click on **\"DK\"** in order to access specific filings. In the \"DK\" page, you'll see a \"tree\" of options with drop\u2011down lists:\n  * **\"Dokumente zur Registernummer\"** contains all documents filed while the company has been registered in its current location. If the company has ever been registered in other towns/districts, there will be options for **\"\u00fcbernommene Dokumente\"** from previous district courts, i.e. filings submitted while at the old locations.\n  * The most commonly needed documents from the \"DK\" view are **shareholder lists** (only available for GmbH companies). A new list is entered whenever there's a change to the shareholder structure. Click on **\"Liste der Gesellschafter\"** and then choose the document with the most recent date to see the current owners (if there are any without dates, choose those too, in case they're the most recent). The actual document should be self\u2011explanatory and clearly dated. By downloading all the lists (including from **\"\u00fcbernommene Dokumente,\"** where relevant), you can see the full ownership history.\n  * From the \"DK\" view you can also access the company's past and current statutes or articles of association under **\"Gesellschaftsvertrag / Satzung / Statut,\"** as well as other corporate filings that aren't so commonly needed.\n* Whether getting a current registry extract (\"AD\") or specific individual filings (\"DK\"), unternehmensregister.de works by adding the documents to your **\"Dokumentenkorb\"** (\"document basket\"). Where given the option, it's best to choose PDF or TIF format rather than ZIP. Add something to the basket by clicking on **\"In den Dokumentenkorb legen.\"** To actually download the document, you then have to click through several pages: **\"Dokumentenkorb ansehen,\"** then **\"Zur Freischaltung,\"** then **\"Jetzt freischalten,\"** then **\"Zum Dokumentenkorb,\"** then finally click on the download icon next to each document in your basket.\n\nFor cross\u2011checks, you can also consult the **Common Register Portal** of the German Federal States (Handelsregister), which aggregates data from individual state registries. The European Commission's e\u2011Justice portal provides an English\u2011language overview of the German business register and links to the official register.\n\n===Searching for an Individual's Affiliations===\n\nIf you want to identify an individual's corporate affiliations, you can search [https://companyhouse.de] by individuals' names (at least if you're logged in with Sastre's account). Individuals' pages on companyhouse.de list all past and current affiliations as a director (**Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer**) or **Prokurist** (authorised signatory), as well as their date of birth and (most recent) place of residence. Ownership relationships aren't usually listed (though occasionally they are, especially for KG companies). The date of birth listed on companyhouse.de is reliable, but the dates of affiliations are very unreliable, so affiliations should ideally be confirmed on unternehmensregister.de as outlined above if you're going to mention them in a report. There's no simple way to search for companies that a person owns; the best approach is to use unternehmensregister.de to check the ownership of any companies where the subject is a director or where you have other reasons to suspect a connection.\n\n===Company Finances===\n\nOfficial annual financial statements (called *Jahresabschl\u00fcsse*) are available from both [https://companyhouse.de] and [https://www.unternehmensregister.de]. In terms of the statements' contents, both websites are equally reliable\u2014if one website doesn't have a particular year, check the other. On companyhouse.de, go to the **\"Jahresabschl\u00fcsse\"** tab on a company's page and choose the statement you want to see. If you're logged into Sastre's account, they should be free to view. On unternehmensregister.de, search a company's name in the **\"Schnellsuche\"** field. On the results page, for companies that have statements available, each statement is listed beneath the company name (e.g., **\"Jahresabschluss zum Gesch\u00e4ftsjahr vom 01.01.2010 bis zum 31.12.2010\"** for the 2010 report). For older documents or those filed with state registers, you might need to use the **Common Register Portal** or state\u2011specific archives.\n\n===Miscellaneous Notes===\n\n* Ownership information isn't usually available for AG companies, unless they publish it themselves on their website or in their annual reports.\n* There's no good way to search for a given company's subsidiaries or shareholdings, but these are sometimes listed in *Jahresabschl\u00fcsse*.\n* **Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer** is best translated as \"director\" and **Prokurist** as \"authorised signatory.\"\n* Regardless of which websites you use to access German corporate records, it's best to cite them as \"German corporate records\" or similar in your footnotes. Don't link directly to companyhouse.de, which is a third\u2011party aggregator.\n\n===Additional Corporate Registry Resources===\n\n* [https://id.occrp.org/databases/#germany OCCRP ID Database for Germany] (''pub'')\n* [https://www.handelsregister.de/rp_web/mask.do?Typ=e Common Register Portal of the] German Federal States (''pub'')\n* [https://www.firmen-in-berlin.com/sites/fitber/welcome.aspx Companies in Berlin - Business] Database of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) Berlin (''pub'')\n* [https://beta.e-justice.europa.eu/106/EN/business_registers_in_eu_countries?GERMANY&member=1 European Commission e\u2011Justice Overview of] German business registers (''pub'')\n* [https://www.deutsche-boerse-cash-market.com/dbcm-de/instrumente-statistiken/statistiken/gelistete-unternehmen Frankfurt Stock Exchange listed companies] (''pub'')\n* [http://www.dihk.de/ihk-finder IHK\u2011Finder - German Chamber of] Commerce directory (''pub'')\n* [https://www.unternehmensregister.de/ureg/?submitaction=language&language=en The German Company Registry (Unternehmensregister)] (''pub'')\n* [https://www.bundesanzeiger.de/ebanzwww/wexsservlet Bundesanzeiger - German Federal Gazette] (''pub'')\n* [https://www.companyhouse.de/ Companyhouse - third-party corporate registry] service (''paid'')\n* [https://www.transparenzregister.de/treg/de/start?1 Transparency Register (UBO register)] (''pub'', ''reg'') \u2013 the official register of beneficial owners; access requires registration.",

It alone undertakes the judicial control in respect of the constitutionality of the laws and regulations, and shall undertake the interpretation of the legislative texts in the manner prescribed by law. In addition, the court is empowered to settle competence disputes between the judicial and the administrative courts. \n\nCourt of Cassation (Ma\u1e25kamet El Naq\u1e0d) \n\nThe Court of Cassation includes consideration of challenges brought to it by either party or by the public prosecution office. It also includes examining lawsuits related to judges' actions. In such a case, the court undertakes its role as a court of merit, rather than a court of law. It also has the power to give rulings on requests of reparations for all violated verdicts. The court issues annual collections on approved judicial principles under the title \"Rulings and Principles of The Court of Cassation\". \n\nCourt of Appeal \n\nCourts of Appeal, some which are called Higher Courts of Appeal, have the competence to consider rulings by the courts of first instance falling under its jurisdiction, should these rulings be liable for appeal. According to the Egyptian judiciary law, there are seven courts of appeal in Egypt; in Cairo, Alexandria, Tanta, Mansoura, Ismailia, Beni Swaif and Assuit. \n\nCourt of First Instance \n\nThese courts of first instance have the competence to consider lawsuits filed before them as may fall under their jurisdictions, and their rulings can be subject to appeal. \n\nCourts of Limited Jurisdiction \n\nThese courts have the competence to issue rulings on lawsuits of limited importance, falling under their geographical and term jurisdictions; their rulings can also be subject to appeal. \n\nFamily Court \n\nFamily courts provide a specialized judiciary tool that would take cognizance of such cases in an atmosphere different from that of other lawsuits. This aims to secure psychological peace for children who may be involved, especially in such cases of tutelage, divorce, alimony, custody, etc. The ultimate objective of this court is to negotiate an amicable settlement of family problems through specialized guidance bureaus. \n\n[https://www.cc.gov.eg/civil_appeals_services Egyptian Court of Cassation] \n\nThe website has Arabic search for Civil and Criminal appeal cases by case number.  \n \n[https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/search/ Global Legal Monitor - Egypt] \n\n[http://www.worldlii.org/catalog/2669.html WorldLII] \n\nA third-party must be engaged to manually search courts in Egypt to obtain copies of litigation records or summaries of the litigation. The cost is \u00a3950 per governorate per subject. Turnaround is 10-12 working days.  \n\nThere is no reliable online searchable database for litigation records in Egypt.  \n\nMy suggested approach is - assuming there is a HUMINT component to the case - running enquiries and seeing if litigation emerges, and then deciding on whether to engage the third party provider for the court checks.",

This tab can be viewed free of charge, but you need to log in (make a free account or ask Pascal for his login details). However, the filing display function is temperamental.\n\n===Commercial Court Registry Database===\n\n'''[https://www.infogreffe.fr/ Infogreffe]'''\n\nThe older corporate database, maintained by the Commercial Court Registries. Compared to the National Enterprise Register, Infogreffe only offers corporate filings for a fee. However, it does offer the KBIS Extract product (for a fee), which as of July 2023, provided company directors' full DOBs and addresses (compared to the National Register, which gives only mm/yyyy and municipality of residence). Additionally, Infogreffe provides a useful directorship search (current and historical) which may be searched by name and DOB. You can also simply click on one company's director to access a list of all their directorships (not possible on National Register).\n\nVarious company details are available for free, including those listed below. A UBO declaration may be downloaded for free. Directors and other principals are listed.\n\n*address\n*trade name\n*legal form\n*last year's turnover (where declared)\n*activity\n*branch registrations\n*date of registration at current Commercial Court. \nNote: the company's date of registration may not be its date of ''incorporation'' - look at historical filings (Acts and Statutes section on the company's registry page) to check. \n\nFurther detailed documents may be obtained for a fee. The most useful of these are the KBIS current extract (\"KBIS\"), individual filings (\"Acts and Statutes\") and annual accounts. Please note that individual historical filings are likely to be available elsewhere for free (see above and below). Less useful are documents on the company's debt status (expensive), bankruptcy status (available elsewhere for free), and legal position (frequently not available).\n\n===Commercial Gazette Records===\n\n'''[https://www.bodacc.fr/pages/annonces-commerciales/?sort=dateparution BODACC]'''\n\nThe Official Bulletin of Civil and Commercial Announcements (BODACC) is part of France's Official Journal, and regularly publishes announcements which companies are required to make on changes made - though these are very brief. It may be searched by company name or ID (SIREN), and also by keyword, which can identify directors.\n\n===Free Corporate Filings===\n\n'''[https://entreprises.lefigaro.fr/ Le Figaro Entreprises]'''\n\nThis database provides basic identity data on companies and, if available, a table presenting details from their most recent accounts, which may also be downloaded. Further down the company page, a list of the company's corporate announcements as published in BODACC is given (usually not further back than approximately 2008, however, so do check BODACC too). Beyond the corporate announcements, the database lists the company's corporate filings and makes them available for free download. These are the same filings available from Infogreffe for a fee, and from the National Enterprise Register (sometimes).\n\nUnlike the other French corporate records sources, Le Figaro Entreprises is also receptive to Google site searches, which can help identify directors alongside the other methods above.\n\nA further, but rarely-seen, key advantage of Le Figaro Entreprises is that it sources official announcements on companies from the ''infolegale'' service (subscription otherwise required), which collects data on companies from a variety of sources - not just the BODACC and the company's own filings. These announcements can include useful information - for example information on fines applied to companies (see the October 2024 announcement in '''[https://entreprises.lefigaro.fr/lm-wind-power-blades-france-50/entreprise-797671195 this]''' example). Le Figaro Entreprises is therefore the best one-stop shop for French entities.\n\n===Associations and Foundations===\n\n'''[https://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/pages/associations-recherche/?sort=cronosort&disjunctive.source Official Journal]'''\n\nThe Official Journal publishes announcements by associations and foundations (charities).\n\n===Note on identifying ownership===\n\nThis is complex in France. Always check a public company's accounts first to save time.\n\nFrench companies declare changes in ownership in individual filings to the corporate registries. These filings are available through the '''National Enterprise Register''' (purportedly), '''Infogreffe''' (for a fee) and '''Figaro Entreprises''' (overall best option). Scrolling down the list of filings, look for ones described as a change to share capital. Typically, these will consist of notes on a company shareholder meeting detailing the change, and then updated company statutes. If you are (very) lucky, the meeting notes will give an ownership breakdown. However, it is more likely that the change in share capital (and new/departing owners) will be described, but without a description of the status quo pre-change. You will need to work backwards (and often, forwards from the founding statutes) to identify this. If your subject is described as having a sole shareholder, immediately move on to checking the sole shareholder's filings to identify ownership.\n\n===Directorships===\n\nAll of the official corporate records sources listed above may be searched for an individual's ''current'' directorships, as described below. However, third-party aggregator '''[https://www.societe.com/ Soci\u00e9t\u00e9]''' is a good source of information on historic directorships. Limited information on companies is available on the website without a subscription, however, so it is best used only to identify corporate affiliations.\n\n*'''[https://www.infogreffe.fr/ Infogreffe]''' - search by name, surname and mm/yyyy of birth through the Advanced Search\n*'''[https://data.inpi.fr/ Data INPI]''' - search by name, surname through the Advanced Search\n*'''[https://www.bodacc.fr/pages/annonces-commerciales/?sort=dateparution BODACC]''' - search director's \"[surname, name]\" as a keyword\n*'''[https://entreprises.lefigaro.fr/ Le Figaro Entreprises]''' - No internal search, but director names may be searched by external site search (search director's \"[surname, name]\"), which should also identify historic directorships.\n*'''[https://www.sirene.fr/sirene/public/recherche Sirene]''' - Provides a surname/name search for directors and sole partnerships.\n\nNote that while a register of disqualified directors (''Fichier National des Interdits de G\u00e9rer'') exists in France, maintained by the National Council of Commercial Court Clerks, it is not publicly accessible [https://www.cngtc.fr/fr/fnig.html source].\n\n===Additional Corporate Resources===\n\n* [https://beta.e-justice.europa.eu/106/EN/business_registers_in_eu_countries?FRANCE&member=1 European Commission's overview of publicly] available business information in France (''pub'')\n* [http://www.societe.com/ Societe - Third-party company information] website\n* [http://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/balo Bulletin of Obligatory Legal Announcements] (''pub'')",

        "wiki_content": "French litigation records are not systematically published, and names of individual parties are widely anonymised. Criminal cases are least publicised of all, but cases of public interest may be covered in the press.\n\nThe courts in France are divided into two parts - the judicial courts (those dealing with criminal and civil laws), and the administrative courts. Public law is applied in the administrative courts (''tribunaux administratifs''). Labour law is applied at labour courts known as ''conseils des prud'hommes''. The highest of the judiciary courts is the ''Cour de cassation'' (Supreme Court of Appeals). There are 36 courts of appeal, 161 ''tribunaux de grande instance'', and 307 ''tribunaux d'instance'' (the lowest level). At the top of the administrative courts rests the ''Conseil d'Etat'' (Council of State), with 8 courts of appeal (''cours administratives d'appel'') and 42 ''tribunaux administratifs''. \n\n'''Disclaimer Text'''\n\n''Litigation records in France include civil, administrative, commercial, labour, and criminal litigation filings for the civil and administrative supreme courts (Cour de Cassation and Conseil d'Etat), the 36 local courts of appeal (Cours d'Appel and Cours d'Appel Administrative), the constitutional court (Conseil Constitutionnel), the competition court (Autorit\u00e9 de la Concurrence), the labour courts (Conseil des Prud'hommes), local civil and administrative high courts.

Search by subject name, although individual parties to cases will be anonymised into initials. It is possible to narrow down using ''expression exacte'' and add name variations with ''associer une autre expression'' to help narrow down results.\n\n'''[https://juricaf.org/recherche/+/facet_pays:France Juricaf]'''\n\nJuricaf is a database of French judgements (and worldwide Francophone Supreme Court judgements) maintained by the Ministry of Justice. For France, it mainly publishes appeal cases from the Court of Cassation, Administrative Court of Appeal and regional courts of appeal, alongside Constitutional Court and State Council administrative judgements, and scattered first-instance judgements.

We note that not all litigation records are made publicly available or are accessible online and therefore these searches should not be considered comprehensive. Further, criminal records are not a matter of public record in the UK. We found no records for cases of which *** has been party to.\n\n===Legal System===\n\nThe UK, with the exception of Scotland, has a common law legal system. Judges look to past, relevant precedential decisions and apply their principals to the legal questions before them. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision. Written opinions for precedent-setting decisions are published online as they are of significance and interest to the general public and legal practitioners alike. Case briefs mainly serve to show how a legal decision was arrived at, which requires, to some extent, recounting the circumstances of the underlying dispute. Personal data may be published in judgments, the GDPR notwithstanding. Court records for cases that are neither precedent-setting nor of public importance are not publicly available. The most comprehensive, online UK case law databases are maintained by the UK Judiciary website, the Scottish Courts & Tribunals website, and the British and Irish Legal Information Institute.

All forms of companies (as permitted by the United Kingdom Companies Act) are incorporated and registered with Companies House and file specific details as required by legislation. \n\nUse the search bar to search by company name, number or officer/PSC name. The search results will be organised by tab. To refine your results to companies, click the relevant tab. If searching for disqualified directors, search for their name and then click the 'Disqualifications' tab. Once you click on a company name, you will be brought through to its Overview page. Again, click on the relevant tab to access filings (Filing History), info on officers and PSCs (People), and current and former charges (Charges). In the Filing History tab, you can refind the filings by category by clicking on the relevant box at the top \u2013 for example, you can view Accounts, filings relating to officers, etc. NOTE: it's always a good idea to review the filing history in full as well because sometimes the filtered version does not pick up on relevant documents (e.g. filings that were resubmitted due to an error in the original).\n\nCompany records are retained by Companies House for 20 years after a company is dissolved and stricken off.In response to privacy concerns, and to comply with the GDPR, Companies House will now remove company records from the free online database six years after they are dissolved. Companies House will include registrations, annual reports and other corporate filings, directors, and significant shareholders (25% or more). Companies are also required register incorporation details (including previous names), charges/ mortgages, and insolvency information, and file annual reports (full accounts) and annual confirmation statements (replaced annual return forms in June 2016). \n\nFor full date of birth, including the day, look for documents submitted before 2016.\n\nFor '''archived company details and reports''', use [https://data.occrp.org/ OCCRP Aleph] (''civ'') and/or one of the following services:\n\n*https://companycheck.co.uk (''priv'')\n*https://www.duedil.com (''priv'')\n*https://www.endole.co.uk (''priv'')\n\n[https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search Charity Register] (''pub'')\n\nYou can find out what it does, where it operates, its trustees, and info on income and assets.\n\nAdditionally, OpenCorporates has composed a comprehensive charity register for the UK\nthat includes over 375,000 registered charities. Around a quarter of the Northern Ireland\ncharities have been linked to UK companies registered at Companies House.

PSCs meet one of the following guidelines: the individual directly or indirectly owns over 25 percent of the company's shares or voting rights, or has the right to appoint or remove the majority of the board of directors.\n\n'''Publicly Traded'''\n\nYou can find ownership information and corporate filings on the LSE and the Companies House websites for publicly traded companies. Public companies must have at least two directors and one secretary registered on Companies House. \n\n'''Privately Held'''\n\nCompanies House will often have shareholder information. Ownership/subsidiaries can also sometimes be found in accounts. In the Filing History section, you will find a list of documents. If there are numerous documents, you can narrow your search by keywords namely Capital, Shares, Annual  Return, Confirmation Statement, and Incorporation. You can also narrow your search by selecting the boxes that have these keywords in the Filter by Category subsection. If there are only a few documents, please search all of them. If a company has numerous shareholders and you are unsure on\nhow to report this, first contact your CM to notify him/her that the company's ownership structure is complicated. Secondly, please reach out to more experienced peers or your Performance Manager for assistance. \n\n'''Nonprofit'''\n\nThe Charity Commission in the UK keeps records of Charities in the UK. This website will have corporate filings that sometimes include trustee information.</div>\n</div>\n\n===Directorship===\n\n* available\n:- reverse: yes\n\n===Company Types===\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\n''Details''\n\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n'''Private Company Limited by Shares'''\n\nThis is the most common company type. They usually have 'Limited' or 'Ltd' at the end of the company name.\nThe amount for which shareholders are liable in the event that the company is wound up is limited to the face value of their share in the business. (In contrast, a sole trader is liable for all of the company's debts and can have their personal assets seized.) The company cannot sell shares to the general public (like a PLC can). \n\n'''Public Limited Company (PLC)'''\n\nThis type can sell shares to the general public.\nIt must have share capital of GBP 50,000 or more, of which at least 25% must have been paid up before the company can begin trading. Not all PLCs are listed on a stock exchange.\nThe liability of the company is limited to the value of its reserves.\n\n'''Private Company Limited by Guarantee'''\n\nThis type limits the liability of its guarantors to a pre-agreed amount that they have to pay if the company is wound up.\nNon-profits are often set up like this.\n\nThere is no share capital or shareholders in this company. Its members/owners are the guarantors.\n\n'''Private Unlimited Company'''\n\nThere is no cap to the amount that its members are required to pay if the company is wound up, so they tend to be used for companies where insolvency is a very low risk. They are not required by law to submit annual accounts to Companies House. This makes unlimited companies attractive to businesses that wish to maintain a level of secrecy about their financial status.\n\n'''Limited liability partnership (LLP)'''\n\nAn LLP is owned by its members who have certain responsibilities, including acting in accordance with the partnership agreement. Its members (partners) are only liable for the amount of money they invest, plus any personal guarantees. There's no restriction on the maximum number of partners allowed but there must be at least two members on incorporation, either individuals or limited companies. They are solely for profit-making businesses.\n\n'''Limited partnership (LP)'''\n\nThis is a business association of one or more 'general partners' alongside one or more 'limited partners'. It is the general partner who is personally liable for the partnership's debts and other obligations. Where there is more than one general partner, they are jointly liable for the partnership's debts. Liability is potentially unlimited, so they may face losing personal assets. Each limited partner's personal liability is capped to the amount of their investment (and any personal guarantees they have given). While their original investment may be lost in paying off partnership debts, the limited partner's personal assets cannot be accessed by creditors. \n\n'''Societas Europaea, or SE companies'''\n\nThese can be established in all European Economic Area.\nWhen established in the UK, SEs are a type of public limited company which can be formed as a subsidiary of another company or as a holding company. SE companies can also be created by mergers or from an existing PLC.</div>\n</div>",

        "wiki_content": "===General Company Information (incl. ownership)===\n\nThe first site to check for German companies is https://companyhouse.de. Sastre has an account on this site, and logging in makes some small improvements to what you can see. This website's layout is easily navigable, so it's good to check for a general overview. However, it's not 100% reliable, especially for historical information (including establishment date), so any information to be cited in a report should ideally be verified at https://www.unternehmensregister.de (see below). Moreover, companyhouse.de tries to charge extra for certain information, such as shareholder details, which can be obtained for free from unternehmensregister.de. Never buy any filings from companyhouse.de, because the same documents can all be obtained for free from unternehmensregister.de.\n\nUnternehmensregister.de is very tedious to use, but it has lots of great information, all for free. Here's a step-by-step guide to using it for general corporate information (including ownership):\n* In the \"Schnellsuche\" field on the homepage, enter the name of the company you want.\n* In the results page, scroll to find the right company and click on \"Registerinformationen des Registergerichts\" next to its name. Note that sometimes the company you want doesn't appear at the top of the results, even if you entered the exact name, so be careful not to accidentally choose the wrong company.\n* On the following page, click \"Registerinformationen anzeigen\".\n* On the following page, click \"AD\" for a summary of the company's current details (\"AD\" stands for \"aktueller Abdruck\", i.e. \"current extract\"). For companies with names ending in \"KG\", this will include ownership information. For other companies, it won't.\n* Instead of \"AD\", you can also click on \"DK\" in order to access specific filings. In the \"DK\" page, you'll see a \"tree\" of options with drop-down lists.\n** \"Dokumente zur Registernummer\" contains all documents filed while the company has been registered in its current location. If the company has ever been registered in other towns/districts, there will be options for \"\u00fcbernommene Dokumente\" from previous district courts, i.e. filings submitted while at the old locations. \n** The most commonly needed documents from the \"DK\" view are shareholder lists (which are only available for GmbH companies). A new list is entered whenever there's a change to the shareholder structure. Click on \"Liste der Gesellschafter\" and then choose the document with the most recent date to see the current owners (if there are any without dates, choose those too, in case they're the most recent). The actual document should be self-explanatory and clearly dated. By downloading all the lists (including from \"\u00fcbernommene Dokumente\", where relevant), you can see the full ownership history.\n** From the \"DK\" view you can also access the company's past and current statutes or articles of association under \"Gesellschaftsvertrag / Satzung / Statut\", as well as other corporate filings that aren't so commonly needed.\n* Whether getting a current registry extract (\"AD\") or specific individual filings (\"DK\"), unternehmensregister.de works by adding the documents to your \"Dokumentenkorb\" (\"document basket\"). Where given the option, it's best to choose PDF or TIF format, rather than ZIP. Add something to the basket by clicking on \"In den Dokumentenkorb legen\". To actually download the document you then have to click through several pointless pages: \"Dokumentenkorb ansehen\", then \"Zur Freischaltung\", then \"Jetzt freischalten\", then \"Zum Dokumentenkorb\", then finally click on the download icon next to each document in your basket.\n\n===Searching for an Individual's Affiliations===\n\nIf you want to identify an individual's corporate affiliations, you can search https://companyhouse.de by individuals' names (at least if you're logged in with Sastre's account). Individuals' pages on companyhouse.de should list all past and current affiliations as a director (\"Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer\") or \"Prokurist\" (\"authorized signatory\"), as well as their date of birth and (most recent) place of residence. Ownership relationships aren't usually listed (though occasionally they are, especially for KG companies). The date of birth listed on companyhouse.de is reliable, but the dates of affiliations are very unreliable, so affiliations should ideally be confirmed on unternehmensregister.de as outlined above, if you're going to mention them in a report. There's no simple way to search for companies that a person owns; the best approach is to use Unternehmensregister.de to check the ownership of any companies where the subject is a director, or where you have other reason to suspect a connection.\n\n===Company Finances===\n\nOfficial annual financial statements (called Jahresabschl\u00fcsse) are available from both https://companyhouse.de and https://www.unternehmensregister.de. In terms of the statements' contents, both websites are equally reliable, though if for a given company one website doesn't have them, check the other.\n\nOn companyhouse.de, you just go to the \"Jahresabschl\u00fcsse\" tab on a company's page and choose the statement you want to see. If you're logged into Sastre's account, they should be free to view.\n\nOn unternehmensregister.de, first search a company's name in the \"Schnellsuche\" field. On the results page, for companies that have statements available, each available statement will be listed beneath the company's name, for example \"Jahresabschluss zum Gesch\u00e4ftsjahr vom 01.01.2010 bis zum 31.12.2010\" is the statement for 2010.\n\n===Miscellaneous Notes===\n* Ownership information isn't (usually?) available for AG companies, unless they publish it themselves on their website or in their annual reports.\n* There's no good way to search for a given company's subsidiaries or shareholdings, but these are sometimes listed in Jahresabschl\u00fcsse.\n* \"Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer\" is best translated as \"director\" and \"Prokurist\" is best translated as \"authorized signatory\".\n* Regardless of which websites you use to access German corporate records, it's best to just cite them as \"German corporate records\" or similar in your footnotes. Don't link directly to companyhouse.de.\n\n===Additional Corporate Registry Resources===\n\n* [https://id.occrp.org/databases/#germany OCCRP ID Database for Germany] (''pub'')\n* [https://www.handelsregister.de/rp_web/mask.do?Typ=e Common Register Portal of the] German Federal States (''pub'')\n* [https://www.firmen-in-berlin.com/sites/fitber/welcome.aspx Companies in Berlin - Business] Database of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) Berlin (''pub'')\n* [https://beta.e-justice.europa.eu/106/EN/business_registers_in_eu_countries?GERMANY&amp;member=1 European Commission E-Justice Overview of] German Business Registry (''pub'')\n* [https://www.deutsche-boerse-cash-market.com/dbcm-de/instrumente-statistiken/statistiken/gelistete-unternehmen Frankfurt Stock Exchange Listed Companies] (''pub'')\n* [http://www.dihk.de/ihk-finder IHK-FINDER - German Chamber of] Commerce Directory (''pub'')\n* [https://www.unternehmensregister.de/ureg/?submitaction=language&language=en The German Company Registry (Unternehmensregister)] (''pub'')\n* [https://www.bundesanzeiger.de/ebanzwww/wexsservlet Bundesanzeiger - German Federal Gazette] (''pub'')\n* [https://www.companyhouse.de/ Companyhouse - Third-party Corporate Registry] Service (''paid'')\n* [https://www.transparenzregister.de/treg/de/start?1 Transparency Register (UBO register)] (''pub'', ''reg'')\n\n---\n\n[https://enreg.reestri.gov.ge/main.php?m=new_index&l=en Georgian governmental website for searching] commercial and non-commercial entities with free company documents and English translations (''pub'')\n\n[http://www.napr.gov.ge/pol\tNational Agency of Public Registries]\n\nThe National Agency of Public Registries operates the country's business register.

Judges look to past, relevant precedential decisions and apply their principles to the legal questions before them. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision. Written opinions for precedent-setting decisions are published online as they are of significance and interest to the general public and legal practitioners alike. Case briefs mainly serve to show how a legal decision was arrived at, which requires, to some extent, recounting the circumstances of the underlying dispute. Personal data may be published in judgments. Court records for cases that are neither precedent-setting nor of public importance are not publicly available. The most comprehensive, online Ghana case law databases are maintained by the Ghana Judicial Service website and the Ghana Legal Information Institute. These databases include decisions from all Ghanaian courts and specialty tribunals. The databases search allows for all courts to be searched at once, making knowledge of the subject's address history unessential.</div>\n\n</div>\n* [https://ghalii.org/gh/judgments/supreme-court Supreme Court of Ghana decisions] on the Ghana Legal Information Institute website (''pub'')\n\n* [http://www.judicial.gov.gh/ Government judicial website]  (''pub'')\n\n'''[http://www.bailii.org/ Bailii]''' (''civ'')\n\nA searchable database of British and Irish case law & legislation, European Union case law, Law Commission reports, and other law-related British and Irish material.\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\n''Sources''\n\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n* Ghana Administration Orders;\n* Ghana Child Support Agency Liability Orders;\n* Ghana County Court Judgments ('CCJs');\n* Ghana Fine Defaults;\n* Ghana High Court Judgments;\n* Ghana Tribunal Awards;\n* Isle of Man Judgments;\n* Jersey Judgments;\n* Northern Ireland High Court Judgments;\n* Northern Ireland Judgments;\n* Republic of Ireland Registered Court Judgments;\n* Scotland Ordinary Causes;\n* Scotland Small Claims Summary Cause & Simple Procedure Decrees</div>\n</div>\n'''[https://www.thelawpages.com/court-cases/index.php?res=1 The Law Pages]''' (''civ'')\n\n'''[https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk Scottish Courts and Tribunals]''' (''pub'')\n\nRequired for subjects with an address history in Scotland.\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\n''Search Tips''\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n:-Use the site's \"Search\" bar</div>\n</div>\n'''[http://www.courtsni.gov.uk Northern Ireland Courts]''' (''pub'')\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\n''Search Tips''\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n:-Search for court cases by all of these words from a case name.</div>\n</div>",

It operates under the Ministry of Justice and Attorney General and is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Companies Act, 2019 (Act 992). Companies must file specific details as required by legislation.\n\nUse the search bar on the RGD website to search by company name, number, or officer name. The search results will be organized by tab. To refine your results to companies, click the relevant tab. For disqualified directors, search for their name and click the 'Disqualifications' tab. Once you click on a company name, you will be brought to its Overview page. Click on the relevant tab to access filings (Filing History), info on officers and shareholders (People), and current and former charges (Charges).\n\nCompany records are retained by the RGD for 10 years after a company is dissolved. The RGD includes registrations, annual reports, and other corporate filings, directors, and significant shareholders (25% or more). Companies are required to register incorporation details (including previous names), charges/mortgages, and insolvency information, and file annual reports and annual returns.\n\nFor full date of birth, including the day, look for documents submitted before 2019.\n\n* [https://egovonline.gegov.gov.gh/RGDPortalWeb/portal/RGDHome/eghana.portal?_nfpb=true&_st=&_pageLabel=portal_RGDHome_NameSearchPage_page&linksPageTitle=Name+Search&service=namesearch#wlp_portal_RGDHome_NameSearchPage_page Registrar General's Department Portal -] simple name search of registered companies in Ghana (only company status and type available) (''pub'')\n\n* [https://gse.com.gh/ Ghana Stock Exchange - lists] all listed companies with capital, incorporation, address, contact information, directors, press releases, financial statements and statistics (''pub'')\n\n* [http://directory.africa-business.co...

PSCs meet one of the following guidelines: the individual directly or indirectly owns over 25 percent of the company's shares or voting rights, or has the right to appoint or remove the majority of the board of directors.\n\n'''Publicly Traded'''\n\nYou can find ownership information and corporate filings on the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) and the RGD websites for publicly traded companies. Public companies must have at least two directors and one secretary registered with the RGD.\n\n'''Privately Held'''\n\nThe RGD will often have shareholder information. Ownership/subsidiaries can also sometimes be found in accounts. In the Filing History section, you will find a list of documents. If there are numerous documents, you can narrow your search by keywords such as Capital, Shares, Annual Return, Confirmation Statement, and Incorporation. If there are only a few documents, please search all of them. If a company has numerous shareholders and you are unsure how to report this, contact your CM to notify him/her that the company's ownership structure is complicated.\n\n'''Nonprofit'''\n\nThe Charity Commission in Ghana keeps records of charities. This website will have corporate filings that sometimes include trustee information.</div>\n\n</div>\n===Directorship===\n\navailable\n:- reverse: yes\n===Company Types===\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\n''Details''\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n'''Private Company Limited by Shares'''\nThis is the most common company type. They usually have 'Limited' or 'Ltd' at the end of the company name. The amount for which shareholders are liable in the event that the company is wound up is limited to the face value of their share in the business. The company cannot sell shares to the general public (like a PLC can).\n\n'''Public Limited Company (PLC)'''\n\nThis type can sell shares to the general public. It must have share capital of GHS 50,000 or more, of which at least 25% must have been paid up before the company can begin trading. Not all PLCs are listed on a stock exchange. The liability of the company is limited to the value of its reserves.\n\n'''Private Company Limited by Guarantee'''\n\nThis type limits the liability of its guarantors to a pre-agreed amount that they have to pay if the company is wound up. Non-profits are often set up like this. There is no share capital or shareholders in this company. Its members/owners are the guarantors.\n\n'''Private Unlimited Company'''\n\nThere is no cap to the amount that its members are required to pay if the company is wound up, so they tend to be used for companies where insolvency is a very low risk. They are not required by law to submit annual accounts to the RGD. This makes unlimited companies attractive to businesses that wish to maintain a level of secrecy about their financial status.\n\n'''Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)'''\n\nAn LLP is owned by its members who have certain responsibilities, including acting in accordance with the partnership agreement. Its members (partners) are only liable for the amount of money they invest, plus any personal guarantees. There's no restriction on the maximum number of partners allowed but there must be at least two members on incorporation, either individuals or limited companies. They are solely for profit-making businesses.\n\n'''Limited Partnership (LP)'''\n\nThis is a business association of one or more 'general partners' alongside one or more 'limited partners'. It is the general partner who is personally liable for the partnership's debts and other obligations. Where there is more than one general partner, they are jointly liable for the partnership's debts. Liability is potentially unlimited, so they may face losing personal assets. Each limited partner's personal liability is capped to the amount of their investment (and any personal guarantees they have given). While their original investment may be lost in paying off partnership debts, the limited partner's personal assets cannot be accessed by creditors.\n\n'''Societas Europaea, or SE companies'''\n\nThese can be established in all European Economic Area. When established in Ghana, SEs are a type of public limited company which can be formed as a subsidiary of another company or as a holding company. SE companies can also be created by mergers or from an existing PLC.</div>\n\n</div>",

        "wiki_content": "[https://www.businessregistry.gr/publicity/index GEMI Public Records]\n\nGreece's online corporate register, the GEMI was launched in 2011. Some companies are missing. It is searchable for any commercial disclosures  just one of the following pieces of information relating to the company: Tax Identification Number (A.F.M. - Greek abbreviation) or General Commercial Registry (\u0393.\u0395.\u039cI.) number or company name or short name.\n\nCorporate records in Greece can be accessed for free online, although they usually only go back a few years. They will usually disclose the directors or administrators of a company. Shareholders are sometimes listed in the accounts or articles of association but this is hit or miss. Financial statements are often provided. If you want to be sure you have all of the filings back as far as incorporation, you need to get someone to go to the registry and look through the physical file of the company.\n\nYou can only search by company, not by director or shareholder. Use Orbis and OpenCorporates for this or else a contributor (talk to CC). You can search by the company's name, but the best way to search is by using the 12-digit company number (\u0391\u03c1. \u0393.\u0395.\u039c\u0397) or 9-digit tax number (\u0391\u03a6\u039c). You can get these in Orbis or OpenCorporates. Click through into the company's profile to get to the filings which are listed at the bottom. If you can't find the company in the registry, try finding it in OpenCorporates and clicking through on the link it provides. Note: if you're searching for a Greek company in OpenCorporates, use uppercase Greek letters. The bottom line is that the registry's online search is a little unreliable so be careful about concluding that a company isn't registered there, is inactive or hasn't filed anything.

The 13 administrative regions (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2, Perif\u00e9ries) are each headed by a popularly elected governor (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2, Periferi\u00e1rhis) and presided over by the popularly elected regional council (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf, Periferiak\u00f3 Simvo\u00falio). Each of the 74 regional units (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u0395\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, Periferiak\u00e9s En\u00f3ti\u0331tes) are headed by a vice governor (\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2, Antiperiferi\u00e1rhis), who is taken from the same political party as the elected governor. The 13 regions are mostly political and geographically. Greece is home to nine regions: Thrace, with the capital Alexandroupolis, Macedonia, with the capital of Thessaloniki; Epirus; Central Greece; Pelloponese; the Ionian Islands; the Aegean islands; Crete; and Athens.\n\nGreece's 74 regional units are divided into 325 municipalities (\u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, Dh\u00edmi) which are led by a popularly elected mayor (\u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, Dh\u00edmarhos) and municipal council (\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf, Dhimotik\u00f3 Simvo\u00falio). Each municipality is divided into small municipal units (\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u0395\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, Dhimotik\u00e9s En\u00f3tites) which in turn contain municipal communities (relatively urban communities) and local communities (relatively rural communities). Municipal councils select community members to serve on more local town hall councils which focus on local needs in the municipality's communities and give local feedback to the municipal government.\n\n\nLitigation records aren't easily accessible in Greece so you will likely need a contributor for this research.\n\nJustis VLex contains very limited filings from certain Greek courts, mostly from before 2000 so not very helpful.",

        "wiki_content": "===General Company Information (incl. ownership)===\n\nThe first site to check for Irish companies is [https://search.cro.ie/company/CompanySearch.aspx Companies Registration Office] (CRO).  This is the official registry.  A basic search by company name or number returns background data such as the company\u2019s legal form, registration number, status, address and date of incorporation.  To obtain more detailed information you must pay for individual corporate filings (e.g. annual returns or director/shareholder changes).  These filings give only a basic description of changes and do not always include shareholding details.  As of 2025 the search portal is free to use for basic information but each filing costs \u20ac2.50.  CRO also publishes weekly gazette lists of companies making insolvency or wind-up filings (see below).\n\n[https://www.solocheck.ie/ SoloCheck] \u2013 a paid-for company-check service that is more expensive than the CRO but much more efficient.  A basic report (about \u20ac4) provides background data and the names of directors.  A full credit report (about \u20ac10) identifies directors (with their dates of birth, addresses and possible other affiliations based on name and DOB combination) and shareholders, alongside key financials for the past five years.  A list of judgments may be provided if relevant.  This is usually cheaper and faster than buying multiple CRO filings for \u20ac2.50 each.\n\n[https://ie.globaldatabase.com/ Global Database] \u2013 an aggregator which has sometimes provided Irish company shareholder information for free.  It pulls data from a variety of sources.  (See this [https://ie.globaldatabase.com/company/dave-barry-plastics-limited example].)\n\n[https://id.occrp.org/databases/#ireland OCCRP ID \u2013 search government] gazettes for company-related notices (''pub'').

This page explains what information is available in the Irish registry and provides links to the CRO portal and other official resources.\n\n[https://register.rbo.gov.ie/ Registered Beneficial Owner (RBO) registry] (''pub'', ''reg'').  The RBO contains details of the ultimate beneficial owners of Irish companies and industrial and provident societies.  Since 2022 the register is not publicly searchable; access is limited to competent authorities and designated persons, so researchers must rely on filings filed before the restriction or request information under applicable regulations.\n\n[http://www.irisoifigiuil.ie/ Irish State Gazette \u2013 official] company notices (''pub'').  The official gazette publishes company-related notices (e.g. change of name, dissolutions, liquidations).  It is not searchable; notices are published chronologically in PDF issues.\n\nAdditional resources for company research include [https://www.companyhouse.ie/ CompanyHouse.ie] (third-party site for basic company info), [https://www.opencorporates.com/companies/ie OpenCorporates] (aggregated global company database) and [https://www.dubilinfolink.com Company Registration Office Ireland \u2013 CRO Search] (alternative portal to CRO).  These sites should be cross-checked with the official CRO.\n\n===Searching for an Individual\u2019s Affiliations===\n\nIf you want to identify an individual\u2019s corporate affiliations, you can search [https://ie.globaldatabase.com/ Global Database] by a person\u2019s name.  SoloCheck offers an \u201cIndividual Credit Report\u201d (about \u20ac9) which pulls information from the Revenue Defaulters database and other sources; it will reveal whether there are judgements or defaults against the person.  However, there is no comprehensive public register of shareholders.  To determine ownership of companies where a person is a director, check the share registers in CRO filings (e.g. \u201cAnnual Return B1\u201d) or use Global Database if available.  The RBO (beneficial ownership) register is not public; only competent authorities and designated persons can search it.\n\n===Company Finances===\n\nOfficial annual financial statements for Irish companies are filed with the CRO and are available through the CRO search for \u20ac2.50 per document.  SoloCheck and Global Database often provide recent financial statements and key ratios (profit, turnover, assets and liabilities) in their paid reports.  If the CRO or SoloCheck doesn\u2019t have a given year\u2019s statement, check the company\u2019s own website or press releases; publicly listed companies also file accounts with the Irish Stock Exchange (see below).\n\n===Miscellaneous Notes===\n\n* Some small Irish companies are exempt from filing detailed accounts (micro companies), so only basic financial statements may be available.\n* The CRO provides a list of disqualified directors and details of persons who are restricted from being directors; this can be searched via the advanced search function at [https://core.cro.ie/search Director Disqualifications].\n* The RBO search has been restricted since 2022; you can no longer freely search beneficial owners.\n* Whenever citing Irish corporate records in a report, describe them generically as \u201cIrish corporate records\u201d rather than linking directly to third-party sites.\n* There is no free comprehensive register of company subsidiaries; these may be listed in annual financial statements.\n\n===Additional Corporate Registry Resources===\n\n* [https://id.occrp.org/databases/#ireland OCCRP ID Database] (''pub'') \u2013 includes Ireland among its covered jurisdictions.\n* [https://beta.e-justice.europa.eu/106/EN/business_registers_in_eu_countries?member=1 European Commission E-Justice portal] (''pub'') \u2013 lists and links to EU member business registers, including Ireland.",

        "wiki_content": "The [https://www.lbr.lu/ '''Luxembourg Business Registers'''] website provides access to the Trade and Companies Register (\"RCS\"; corporate registry), Electronic Compendium of Companies and Associations (corporate announcements publication) and Register of Beneficial Owners. The latter is inaccessible as of January 2024 due to an EU ruling restricting access to beneficial ownership records.\n\nUpon accessing the RCS, click the login link in the top left and log in \"as an anonymous user\", which does not require a profile. Without logging in, you will only be able to search the RCS and access basic background information on companies: name, registered address, date of incorporation, legal form, activity, and dissolution/liquidation data if applicable. \n\nAfter logging in and navigating to subject company page, additional information can be accessed through corporate filings, listed below the background information. Each filing is listed with a description stating the information changed/added upon submission of that filing. Filings dating prior to approximately 2002 will be available in a separate tab entitled \"Archived files\", if applicable - open the \"Publication\" file to see all filings with changes to company data since incorporation (and ignore the arbitrary date of \"1950\"). Click the \"pdf\" icon next to each filing to access it, and it will open in a new browser page. The site only permits a user to access one filing at once.\n\nFilings are published in French (with German translation), and cannot be machine translated in the page due to the pdf format (try Google Translate mobile app through camera), but in a relatively intuitive submission form format. Annual accounts of international companies may be submitted in both French and English. Note the following non-standard translations of filing descriptions:\n\n*''Exercise from [date] to [date]'' = the company's annual accounts for that period\n*''social capital / social funds'' = changes to share capital (and sometimes ownership)\n*''associates'' = owners\n*''social object'' = company activity\n*''administrators/managers'' = statutory directors / board members\n*''daily management delegates'' = executives (usually CEO or Managing Director only)\n*''registration'' = incorporation\n\nThe RCS also offers an extract of current data on a company for EUR 12.20. As of January 2024, the author of this guide has never had cause to spend this money, and is unaware of the extract's contents. However, given the general similarities between the Luxembourgish and French corporate filing systems, the author proposes that the information available may broadly match extracts available from the [http://3.142.143.3:4001/index.php/France#Commercial_Court_Registry_Database '''French Commercial Court Register'''].\n\nThe aforementioned Electronic Compendium of Companies and Associations also provides access to company filings, with the same information as given in the RCS. Alongside providing information on non-business entities, its main difference from the RCS is that its name search function returns all filings from companies whose name matches the search term.\n\nAdditional corporate registry resources include:\n* [https://memorialc.public.lu/ Archive] of corporate announcements (not filings) published between 1997 and 2016. Receptive to site search - making it the only option for reverse director searches. Results are delivered as French-language pdfs with announcement text, brief description of changes.\n* [https://beta.e-justice.europa.eu/106/EN/business_registers_in_eu_countries?LUXEMBOURG&member=1 European Commission E-Justice (Luxembourg)]  (''pub'')\n* [https://www.lbr.lu/mjrcs/jsp/IndexActionNotSecured.action?time=1553687414220 Luxembourg Business Registry]  (''pub'', ''paid'')\n* [https://ebr.bundesanzeiger-datenser... European Business Register (Luxembourg) via] the Bundesanzeiger Verlag (''pub'', ''paid'', ''reg'')\n* [http://www.legilux.public.lu/entr/s... Legilux - official judicial portal] of the Government of Luxembourg (''pub'')\n\n'''Ownership'''\n\nTo identify a company's ownership, check '''all''' (or at least several) corporate filings bearing the \"associates\" description. These only present information on what was changed upon the announcement - note that this can be just a change to an individual shareholder's information (e.g. change of address). Previously-existing shareholdings omitted from a given filing will not have changed, and you will need to check previous (sometimes several) \"associates\" filings to identify other information; if in doubt, check how much share capital the company declared in its most recent annual report, and compare this with all known shareholdings. In cases of a change in ownership, the previous owner will be shown in strikethrough (in recent, non-archived filings) in the submission form. Also check the filings described as \"social capital\", as these may involve changes in existing shareholders' relative stakes. Both \"associates\" and \"social capital\" filings will present details on the change first in a submission form format, and further down include the full original corporate announcement on the change, which will describe the process and potentially rationale behind the change (but will likely limit itself to describing the ownership change only, not the full ownership structure). Such announcements (usually written in French, but sometimes in English) may also give the company's full statutes, which can give useful background information.\n\nIf there are no \"associates\" filings, check the first \"registration\" filing, which will identify the company's owners upon incorporation - but only in the section of the filing giving the original corporate announcement. If the company was incorporated before ~2002, its initial incorporation filing will be available from the \"Publication\" file under the \"Archived files\" tab. Ordinarily, the announcement will begin by stating that \"on [date], before [Notary name] appeared Shareholder X and Shareholder Y... to request the formation of a company between them\", then give the company's statutes, and after the statutes present a table or list of initial share capital subscriptions. After collecting initial shareholding information in this manner, be sure to then work forward and check for changes to share capital which might affect the initial ownership structure. \n\nFilings give natural persons' (owners and directors) full name, contact address, and date and place of birth (but not citizenship - although company establishment announcements sometimes give foreign direct shareholders' passport numbers, and also sometimes occupation). Luxembourgish corporate shareholders and directors are identified by their name and ID number. For foreign corporate shareholders and directors, the RCS gives name, country of registry, ID number, entity type, and address; note that these details' veracity can only be guaranteed as of the date of filing.\n\n\n'''Directorship'''\n\nDirectorship searches are not available. Check a company's \"administrators/managers\" and \"daily management delegates\" filings to identify principals. Note that these will be submitted if a principal's data (e.g. address) changes, not just if a new person is appointed. The one-page form of information given on a principal will indicate their date of appointment at the bottom - but, if the principal was appointed for a fixed term, the appointment date indicated may actually be the date the position was most recently renewed, so it is worth checking historic records as well to confirm.\n\n'''However''', while no specific directorship search is available, some historic information is available from archives of ''M\u00e9morial C'', the corporate announcements section of the Luxembourg Gazette, which was discontinued in June 2016 and replaced with the Electronic Compendium of Companies and Associations referenced above. A digitised archive of announcements dated 1996-2016 is hosted on '''https://memorialc.public.lu/''' which is receptive to Chrome site search. No alternative is available for filings dating since 2016.\n\n\n'''Insolvency'''\n\nThe RCS manages Luxembourg's Insolvency Register, which maintains details on corporate entities only. Every month, the RCS publishes a list of insolvencies recorded in the previous period. Archives are not available. However, if a company is currently in insolvency, this will be displayed prominently on its RCS profile page. \n\nA \"negative certification\", checking for historic insolvencies, on a subject company may be ordered for EUR 4.50.\n\n* [https://www.lbr.lu/mjrcs/jsp/DisplayCourtOrderActionNotSecured.action?FROM_LANGUAGE_CHANGE=true&CURRENT_TIMESTAMP_ID=&FROM_MENU=true&currentMenuLabel=menu.item.courtorder&time=1630056293586 The Luxembourg Business Register publishes] lists of company bankruptcies, liquidations and administrations monthly (''pub'')",

(''pub'')\n\n===Note on Identifying Ownership===\n\nOwnership identification can be complex in Mexico. Always check a public company's accounts first to save time.\n\nMexican companies declare changes in ownership in individual filings to the corporate registries. These filings are available through the '''National Enterprise Register''', '''Buho Legal''' (for a fee), and '''Sayari Graph''' (overall best option). Scrolling down the list of filings, look for ones described as a change to share capital. Typically, these will consist of notes on a company shareholder meeting detailing the change, and then updated company statutes. If you are (very) lucky, the meeting notes will give an ownership breakdown. However, it is more likely that the change in share capital (and new/departing owners) will be described, but without a description of the status quo pre-change. You will need to work backward (and often forward from the founding statutes) to identify this. If your subject is described as having a sole shareholder, immediately move on to checking the sole shareholder's filings to identify ownership.\n\n===Directorships===\n\nDirectorship searches are available through all of the official corporate records sources listed above, namely:\n\n* '''[https://www.buholegal.com/ Buho Legal]''' - search by name, surname, and mm/yyyy of birth through the Advanced Search\n* '''[https://www.sayari.com/ Sayari Graph]''' - search by name, surname through the Advanced Search\n* '''[https://www.dof.gob.mx/ Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n]''' - search director's \"[surname, name]\" as a keyword\n* '''Registro P\u00fablico de Comercio (RPC)''' - Provides a surname/name search for directors and sole partnerships.\n\nNote that while a register of disqualified directors (''Fichero Nacional de Directores Descalificados'') exists in Mexico, maintained by the National Council of Commercial Court Clerks, it is not publicly accessible.",

The database search accepts certain Boolean operators. Note that the Judicial Organ website also publishes case reports from a monthly bulletin (2010-21 available as of May 2025) and other assorted sources. It is unclear whether these results are also available through the Judicial Management System. The Judicial Organ web domain is receptive to site search, so it's best to run both a site search and Judicial Management System database search.\n\nThe Judicial Management System publishes selected rulings issued by the Supreme Court of Justice and Superior Tribunal, including the latter's specialised chambers for appeal, labour, maritime and family cases. The database includes selected civil and criminal judgements issued since 1993. Research in May 2025 indicated that litigation records on cases examined by Panama's regional-level Circuit Courts and first-instance Municipal Courts is not available online.",

However, reverse directorship checks are not available in the Philippines.\nFor corporations and partnerships, you can order General information sheets which include information such as dates of incorporation, identities of directors and shareholders, subsidiaries, and contact information.\n\nTo identify a company's ownership, check all corporate filings bearing the \"associates\" description. These only present information on what was changed upon the announcement - note that this can be just a change to an individual shareholder's information (e.g. change of address). Previously-existing shareholdings omitted from a given filing will not have changed, and you will need to check previous (sometimes several) \"associates\" filings to identify other information.\nIf there are no \"associates\" filings, check the first \"registration\" filing, which will identify the company's owners upon incorporation.\n\nThese records can be paid for online using a credit card, but they cannot be viewed online. Instead, they are couriered to a physical address in the Philippines, which typically takes between 5-7 working days. Alternatively, you can schedule an appointment to pick them up in person at the SEC.\n\nIf you don't have someone in the Philippines who can receive, scan, and send these documents to you, you'll need to use a third-party provider.\n\nFor sole proprietorships, the only information you can check online is whether the business name has been registered. This can be done by starting the process of registering a new entity on the [https://bnrs.dti.gov.ph/ '''Department of Trade and Industry's Business Name Registration System'''] website.\n\nAdditional resources:\n* [http://www.sec.gov.ph/online-services/search-registered-companies/ Securities and Exchange Commission Philippines] (''pub'')\n* [https://bnrs.dti.gov.ph/search Business Name Registration Search (BNRS)] - Department of Trade and Industry (''pub'')\n* [http://www.poea.gov.ph/cgi-bin/agli...

RPVS is a legally established list of data on public sector partners, and these partners are obliged to provide information on all direct and indirect shareholders.\n\nA public sector partner is a natural person, a natural person-entrepreneur, and a legal entity that receives from the state, local government, and other entities of the public sector monetary payment or property above the limit specified by law.\n\nPublic sector partners are required to register with an authorized person who performs all actions related to the RPVS on behalf of the public sector partner.\n\n===Directorship===\n\n* Available\n* Reverse: yes\n\n===Company Types===\n\n====Limited Liability Company (s.r.l.)====\nOne of the most common types of companies in Romania is the limited liability company. Such types of Romanian companies must be formed with a minimum investment of RON 200. A minimum of one shareholder and one director are essential for forming a limited liability company in Romania. The shareholders may be either natural persons or corporations. An s.r.l.'s shareholders assume limited responsibility for the organization, meaning they are not personally liable for the various monetary loans or liabilities of the corporation.\n\n====Joint Stock Company (S.A.)====\nA JSC's stockholders have restricted responsibility, which implies that if the business accrues difficulties or obligations, their finances are not in danger. As such, the stockholders of an S.A. are only financially responsible for their investment's value. Such types of companies in Romania must have RON 90,000 as the required capital in order to be formed.\n\n====General Partnership (s.n.c.)====\nA General Partnership is one of the types of business in Romania where two or more individuals jointly control and run the business that is operating under a single trade name. Partners in such businesses split their earnings and expenses equally. Every member is entirely accountable for the financial commitments and responsibilities of the partnership company.\n\n====Limited Partnership (s.c.s.)====\nIn a limited partnership, the general partners are fully responsible for the monetary debts and responsibilities associated with the firm. The general partner is in charge of running the business in such types of companies in Romania. Limited partners have restricted liability and as such, they are only responsible for the value of funds they have contributed to the partnership.",

Search all former addresses as well. Make a note of the email/phone number of each relevant District and Appeals Court and make a list of subjects you want to enquire about. Note: You need to enquire by organisation number or ID number, rather than company/subject name.\n \nStep 3: Call each court one by one.

Sole shareholders are disclosed.\n\n[https://esm.justice.cz/ias/issm/rejstrik-$sm UBO Register]\n\nInformation on who meets the criteria of a beneficial owner: {- https://esm.justice.cz/ias/issm/napoveda#zmenyNew ]\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\nResearch Guide\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n\n'''Ultimate Beneficial Ownership''' \n\nUltimate beneificial ownership may be found through the '''Register of Public Sector Partners (RPVS).''' RPVS is a legally established list of data on '''public sector partners, and these partners are obliged to provide information on all direct and indirect shareholders.'''\n\nA public sector partner is a natural person, a natural person-entrepreneur and a legal entity that receives from the state, local government and other entities of the public sector monetary payment or property above the limit specified by law. In addition, persons who enter into a contract, framework agreement or concession agreement according to the regulations on public procurement, health care providers, a person to whom a claim against the state or public sector entities is assigned or otherwise transferred, must also be entered in the register - taking into account financial limits. as well as subcontractors. Health insurance companies are also partners of the public sector.\n\nNatural persons, natural persons-entrepreneurs and legal entities that are not partners of the public sector can also voluntarily enroll in the RPVS. The platform for disclosure of end-users of benefits in the register of public sector partners can also be used by entities other than public sector partners, for example business partners for their B2B business relationships.\n\nThe public sector partner does not register himself in the RPVS. For this purpose, he must secure an authorized person (according to the law, this is a lawyer, notary, bank, branch of a foreign bank, auditor or tax advisor with a registered office or place of business in the territory of the Slovak Republic), with whom he must conclude an agreement on the fulfillment of the duties of the authorized person for the partner public sector. Subsequently, this authorized person performs all actions related to the RPVS on behalf of the public sector partner (that is, not only the initial entry, but also the change or deletion of entered data).\n\nAccording to  \u00a7 11 par. 2 letters c) Act no. 315/2016 Coll. on the register of public sector partners  and on the amendment of certain laws as amended by Act no. 38/2017 Coll. (hereinafter referred to as ZRPVS), '''the authorized person is obliged to verify the identification of the final user of the benefits of the public sector partner'''  as of 31.12 . The authorized person can fulfill the mentioned obligation  no earlier than 31.12 . He cannot send verification before this day; the purpose of the provisions of \u00a7 11 par. 2 letters c) ZRPVS is to declare the status as of 31.12. of the relevant calendar year and not earlier .\n\nZRPVS does not specify the longest possible period when a notice of court verification can be sent after this date. At the same time, however, in accordance with \u00a7 11 par. 6 ZRPVS, this notification can be sent  \"immediately\" after the authorized person succeeds in finding out the result - that the final user of the benefits has not changed. This means that it is possible to send a notification about the verification of the identification of the end user of the benefits even after 31.12. However, it is necessary to be aware that failure to fulfill the obligation to verify identification may mean suspension of performance by the public sector for the public sector partner until the said obligation is fulfilled , i.e. until the moment when the date of the notification on the verification of the end users of the benefits appears in register of public sector partners.  </div>\n</div>\n\n===Directorship===\n\n* available\n:- reverse: yes\n\n===Company Types===\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\n''Details''\n\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n'''Limited Liability Company (s.r.o.)'''\n\nOne of the most common types of companies in the Czech Republic is the limited liability company. Such types of Czech companies must be formed with a minimum investment of CZK 1. A minimum of one stockholder and one director are essential for forming a limited liability company in the Czech Republic. The stockholders may be either natural persons or corporations. An SRO's stockholders assume limited responsibility for the organization, meaning they are not personally liable for the various monetary loans or liabilities of the corporation.\n\n'''Limited Partnership (k.s.)'''\n\nIn a limited partnership, the general partners are fully responsible for the monetary debts and responsibilities associated with the firm. The general partner is in charge of running the business in such types of companies in the Czech Republic. Limited partners have restricted liability and as such, they are only responsible for the value of funds they have contributed to the partnership, as specified in the articles of association of the firm.\n\n'''General Partnership (v.o.s.)'''\n\nA General Partnership is one of the types of business in the Czech Republic where two or more individuals jointly control and run the business that is operating under a single trade name. Partners in such businesses split their earnings and expenses equally. Every member is entirely accountable for the financial commitments and responsibilities of the partnership company. As such, each of the members in such types of Czech companies is equally and jointly liable for the monetary obligations and responsibilities of the firm. There isn't any basic investment requirement for forming such types of companies in the Czech Republic.\n\n'''Joint Stock Company (a.s.)'''\n\nA JSC's stockholders have restricted responsibility, which implies that if the business accrues difficulties or obligations, their finances are not in danger. As such, the stockholders of an AS are only financially responsible for their investment's value. Such types of companies in the Czech Republic must have CZK 2,000,000 as the required capital in order to be formed.\n\nThis sort of corporation may be established by at least one stakeholder. The statutory authority for corporations with multiple shareholders is the board of directors, which must have at least 3 persons. A supervisory board of a minimum of 3 people is also required to be established by the joint stock corporation. The three people on the supervisory boards cannot also serve as directors of the corporation in the case of an AS firm.\n\n'''Cooperative (Dru\u017estvo)'''\n\nA cooperative, known as a \"dru\u017estvo,\" is a business that is held and operated by the individuals who consume its commodities and services. The cooperative's main commercial objective is the societal or economical well-being of its participants, who are not individually accountable for the debts as well as liabilities of the enterprise. There isn't any capital necessity for establishing a cooperative, however, it must possess adequate funds to operate. Such types of companies in the Czech Republic must consist of three individuals as a minimum before they may be founded.\n\n'''Sole Proprietorship'''\n\nSuch types of business in the Czech Republic are controlled and managed by a sole person and can be established quickly and easily. In this kind of company entity, a single person operates their own firm on a self-employed basis. According to the Trade License Act, an individual can officially begin their business as a sole proprietor after they turn 18 years old. There isn't any legal distinction between the company's financial resources and those of the proprietor in these types of Czech businesses. As such, the firm proprietor is entirely and solely accountable for all financial debts and responsibilities of the firms.\n\n'''Branch Office'''\n\nA branch office in the Czech Republic is an addition to an international business that conducts business in the nation. A branch office in the Czech Republic isn't regarded as a separate legal organization, thus, the parent firm must authorize all of its business-related decisions. Also, in such types of Czech companies, the parent firm is responsible for the duties and actions of its branch. The Czech legislation governs its formation and inclusion in the Czech commercial registry. International corporations who want to maintain a presence in the Czech Republic without establishing a distinct legal organization might consider opening a branch office there. It enables the parent business to keep oversight of the Branch office's activities. \n\n'''Representative Office'''\n\nA representative office can be established in the Czech Republic by international corporations. A representative office is only permitted to carry out market research or advertise the products and services of its holding organization. Such types of business in the Czech Republic are not permitted to go on trade or enter into agreements.</div>\n</div>",

The judiciary is now comprised of a number of specialized courts: the Judicial Supreme Court, the Administrative Supreme Court, the Accounting Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court, and the Court of State Security.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSubordinate Courts\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nAt the lowest level, customary law courts, presided over by traditional chiefs, mediate local disputes. Courts of first instance (tribunaux de premi\u00e8re instance) and regional high courts (tribunaux de grande instance) appeal cases to the Appeal Courts (Cours d'appel). From the Appeals Courts, cases can be further appealed to the Judicial Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation).\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSupreme Court\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nGabon's highest-level courts are the country's former Supreme Court chambers now broken into three separate supreme courts: a judicial court, an administrative court, and a court of accounts, each having absolute authority over its respective area of expertise. The Judicial Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) oversees ordinary affairs, in other words, criminal, social, commercial, and civil matters. Further, the Administrative Supreme Court (Conseil d'Etat) rules on administrative litigations or judicial review of the activities of the executive branch and other public law bodies. It receives drafts of laws and regulations from the government for legal advice before sending them to Parliament or to the respective cabinet for signature. The Accounting Supreme Court (Cour des Comptes) is responsible for auditing accounts of government and other public and semi-public bodies. It also has the ability to rule on all conflicts arising as the auditing of such bodies and to sanction the relevant authorities, notwithstanding possible criminal investigations and prosecutions.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nConstitutional Court\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Constitutional Court is the highest level court in Gabon with regard to constitutional matters. It has control of the constitutionality of laws before promulgation upon referral by the head of state, or the president of one or the other chamber of Parliament. Every seven years, its judges are appointed as follows: three by the national president, three by the president of the Senate, and three by the president of the National Assembly. These judges serve seven-year terms that can be renewed only once.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nCourt of State Security\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Court of State Security tries the president and other senior government official for acts of high treason. This court also has the power to impeach the president or try them for violations of their presidential oath.",

The department operates under the Ministry of Legal Affairs and ensures compliance with the Companies Act. Companies must file specific details as required by legislation.\n\nUse the search bar on the Grenada Registrar General's website to search by company name, number, or officer name. The search results will be organized by tab. To refine your results to companies, click the relevant tab. For disqualified directors, search for their name and click the 'Disqualifications' tab. Once you click on a company name, you will be brought to its Overview page. Click on the relevant tab to access filings (Filing History), info on officers and shareholders (People), and current and former charges (Charges).\n\nCompany records are retained by the Grenada Registrar General's Department for 10 years after a company is dissolved. The department includes registrations, annual reports, and other corporate filings, directors, and significant shareholders (25% or more). Companies are required to register incorporation details (including previous names), charges/mortgages, and insolvency information, and file annual reports and annual returns.\n\nFor full date of birth, including the day, look for documents submitted before 2019.\n\nFor '''archived company details and reports''', use [https://data.occrp.org/ OCCRP Aleph] (''civ'') and/or one of the following services:\n\n* [https://companycheck.co.uk Company Check] (''priv'')\n* [https://www.duedil.com DueDil] (''priv'')\n* [https://www.endole.co.uk Endole] (''priv'')\n\n[https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search Charity Register] (''pub'')\n\nYou can find out what a charity does, where it operates, its trustees, and info on income and assets.\n\nAdditionally, OpenCorporates has a comprehensive charity register for Grenada that includes registered charities.\n\n===Ownership===\n\n* generally available\n:-reverse: in random cases only, on [https://data.occrp.org/ OCCRP Aleph] (''civ'')\n\nInformation on [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-significant-control-pscs People with significant control]\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\nResearch Guide\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n'''Ultimate Beneficial Ownership'''\n\nBeneficial ownership can be found on the Grenada Registrar General's website by following the chain of ownership or simply looking at the Persons with Significant Control (PSC). PSCs meet one of the following guidelines: the individual directly or indirectly owns over 25 percent of the company's shares or voting rights, or has the right to appoint or remove the majority of the board of directors.\n\n'''Publicly Traded'''\n\nYou can find ownership information and corporate filings on the Eastern Caribbean Securities Exchange (ECSE) and the Grenada Registrar General's websites for publicly traded companies. Public companies must have at least two directors and one secretary registered with the Registrar General.\n\n'''Privately Held'''\n\nThe Grenada Registrar General's Department will often have shareholder information. Ownership/subsidiaries can also sometimes be found in accounts. In the Filing History section, you will find a list of documents. If there are numerous documents, you can narrow your search by keywords such as Capital, Shares, Annual Return, Confirmation Statement, and Incorporation. If there are only a few documents, please search all of them. If a company has numerous shareholders and you are unsure how to report this, contact your CM to notify him/her that the company's ownership structure is complicated.\n\n'''Nonprofit'''\n\nThe Charity Commission in Grenada keeps records of charities. This website will have corporate filings that sometimes include trustee information.\n</div>\n</div>\n\n===Directorship===\n\n* available\n:- reverse: yes\n\n===Company Types===\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\n''Details''\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n'''Private Company Limited by Shares'''\n\nThis is the most common company type. They usually have 'Limited' or 'Ltd' at the end of the company name. The amount for which shareholders are liable in the event that the company is wound up is limited to the face value of their share in the business. The company cannot sell shares to the general public (like a PLC can).\n\n'''Public Limited Company (PLC)'''\n\nThis type can sell shares to the general public. It must have share capital of GHS 50,000 or more, of which at least 25% must have been paid up before the company can begin trading. Not all PLCs are listed on a stock exchange. The liability of the company is limited to the value of its reserves.\n\n'''Private Company Limited by Guarantee'''\n\nThis type limits the liability of its guarantors to a pre-agreed amount that they have to pay if the company is wound up. Non-profits are often set up like this. There is no share capital or shareholders in this company. Its members/owners are the guarantors.\n\n'''Private Unlimited Company'''\n\nThere is no cap to the amount that its members are required to pay if the company is wound up, so they tend to be used for companies where insolvency is a very low risk. They are not required by law to submit annual accounts to the Registrar General. This makes unlimited companies attractive to businesses that wish to maintain a level of secrecy about their financial status.\n\n'''Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)'''\n\nAn LLP is owned by its members who have certain responsibilities, including acting in accordance with the partnership agreement. Its members (partners) are only liable for the amount of money they invest, plus any personal guarantees. There's no restriction on the maximum number of partners allowed but there must be at least two members on incorporation, either individuals or limited companies. They are solely for profit-making businesses.\n\n'''Limited Partnership (LP)'''\n\nThis is a business association of one or more 'general partners' alongside one or more 'limited partners'. It is the general partner who is personally liable for the partnership's debts and other obligations. Where there is more than one general partner, they are jointly liable for the partnership's debts. Liability is potentially unlimited, so they may face losing personal assets. Each limited partner's personal liability is capped to the amount of their investment (and any personal guarantees they have given). While their original investment may be lost in paying off partnership debts, the limited partner's personal assets cannot be accessed by creditors.\n\n'''Societas Europaea, or SE companies'''\n\nThese can be established in all European Economic Area. When established in Grenada, SEs are a type of public limited company which can be formed as a subsidiary of another company or as a holding company. SE companies can also be created by mergers or from an existing PLC.\n</div>\n</div>",

Judges look to past, relevant precedential decisions and apply their principles to the legal questions before them. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision. Written opinions for precedent-setting decisions are published online as they are of significance and interest to the general public and legal practitioners alike. Case briefs mainly serve to show how a legal decision was arrived at, which requires, to some extent, recounting the circumstances of the underlying dispute. Personal data may be published in judgments. Court records for cases that are neither precedent-setting nor of public importance are not publicly available. The most comprehensive, online Grenada case law databases are maintained by the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court website and the Eastern Caribbean Legal Information Institute.

It operates under the Ministry of Economy and ensures compliance with the Commercial Code. Companies must file specific details as required by legislation.\n\nUse the search bar on the Mercantile Registry's website to search by company name, number, or officer name. The search results will be organized by tab. To refine your results to companies, click the relevant tab. For disqualified directors, search for their name and click the 'Disqualifications' tab. Once you click on a company name, you will be brought to its Overview page. Click on the relevant tab to access filings (Filing History), info on officers and shareholders (People), and current and former charges (Charges).\n\nCompany records are retained by the Guatemala Mercantile Registry for 10 years after a company is dissolved. The department includes registrations, annual reports, and other corporate filings, directors, and significant shareholders (25% or more). Companies are required to register incorporation details (including previous names), charges/mortgages, and insolvency information, and file annual reports and annual returns.\n\nFor full date of birth, including the day, look for documents submitted before 2019.\n\nFor '''archived company details and reports''', use [https://data.occrp.org/ OCCRP Aleph] (''civ'') and/or one of the following services:\n\n* [https://companycheck.co.uk Company Check] (''priv'')\n* [https://www.duedil.com DueDil] (''priv'')\n* [https://www.endole.co.uk Endole] (''priv'')\n\n[http://www.registromercantil.gob.gt Registro Mercantil - The General] Mercantile Registry of the Republic of Guatemala containing commercial legislation and administrative procedures (''pub'')\n\n[http://www.guatecompras.gt/proveedores/busquedaProvee.aspx Guatecompras - Searchable database of] registered Guatemalan companies that have contracts with the state (''pub'')\n\n[https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search Charity Register] (''pub'')\n\nYou can find out what a charity does, where it operates, its trustees, and info on income and assets.\n\nAdditionally, OpenCorporates has a comprehensive charity register for Guatemala that includes registered charities.\n\n===Ownership===\n\n* generally available\n:-reverse: in random cases only, on [https://data.occrp.org/ OCCRP Aleph] (''civ'')\n\nInformation on [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-significant-control-pscs People with significant control]\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\nResearch Guide\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n'''Ultimate Beneficial Ownership'''\n\nBeneficial ownership can be found on the Guatemala Mercantile Registry's website by following the chain of ownership or simply looking at the Persons with Significant Control (PSC). PSCs meet one of the following guidelines: the individual directly or indirectly owns over 25 percent of the company's shares or voting rights, or has the right to appoint or remove the majority of the board of directors.\n\n'''Publicly Traded'''\n\nYou can find ownership information and corporate filings on the Guatemala Stock Exchange (BVN) and the Guatemala Mercantile Registry's websites for publicly traded companies. Public companies must have at least two directors and one secretary registered with the Registrar General.\n\n'''Privately Held'''\n\nThe Guatemala Mercantile Registry will often have shareholder information. Ownership/subsidiaries can also sometimes be found in accounts. In the Filing History section, you will find a list of documents. If there are numerous documents, you can narrow your search by keywords such as Capital, Shares, Annual Return, Confirmation Statement, and Incorporation. If there are only a few documents, please search all of them. If a company has numerous shareholders and you are unsure how to report this, contact your CM to notify him/her that the company's ownership structure is complicated.\n\n'''Nonprofit'''\n\nThe Charity Commission in Guatemala keeps records of charities. This website will have corporate filings that sometimes include trustee information.\n</div>\n</div>\n\n===Directorship===\n\n* available\n:- reverse: yes\n\n===Company Types===\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\n''Details''\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n'''Private Company Limited by Shares'''\n\nThis is the most common company type. They usually have 'Limited' or 'Ltd' at the end of the company name. The amount for which shareholders are liable in the event that the company is wound up is limited to the face value of their share in the business. The company cannot sell shares to the general public (like a PLC can).\n\n'''Public Limited Company (PLC)'''\n\nThis type can sell shares to the general public. It must have share capital of Q50,000 or more, of which at least 25% must have been paid up before the company can begin trading. Not all PLCs are listed on a stock exchange. The liability of the company is limited to the value of its reserves.\n\n'''Private Company Limited by Guarantee'''\n\nThis type limits the liability of its guarantors to a pre-agreed amount that they have to pay if the company is wound up. Non-profits are often set up like this. There is no share capital or shareholders in this company. Its members/owners are the guarantors.\n\n'''Private Unlimited Company'''\n\nThere is no cap to the amount that its members are required to pay if the company is wound up, so they tend to be used for companies where insolvency is a very low risk. They are not required by law to submit annual accounts to the Registrar General. This makes unlimited companies attractive to businesses that wish to maintain a level of secrecy about their financial status.\n\n'''Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)'''\n\nAn LLP is owned by its members who have certain responsibilities, including acting in accordance with the partnership agreement. Its members (partners) are only liable for the amount of money they invest, plus any personal guarantees. There's no restriction on the maximum number of partners allowed but there must be at least two members on incorporation, either individuals or limited companies. They are solely for profit-making businesses.\n\n'''Limited Partnership (LP)'''\n\nThis is a business association of one or more 'general partners' alongside one or more 'limited partners'. It is the general partner who is personally liable for the partnership's debts and other obligations. Where there is more than one general partner, they are jointly liable for the partnership's debts. Liability is potentially unlimited, so they may face losing personal assets. Each limited partner's personal liability is capped to the amount of their investment (and any personal guarantees they have given). While their original investment may be lost in paying off partnership debts, the limited partner's personal assets cannot be accessed by creditors.\n\n'''Societas Europaea, or SE companies'''\n\nThese can be established in all European Economic Area. When established in Guatemala, SEs are a type of public limited company which can be formed as a subsidiary of another company or as a holding company. SE companies can also be created by mergers or from an existing PLC.\n</div>\n</div>",

Persons with Significant Control (PSC) guidelines include individuals who directly or indirectly own over 25 percent of the company\u2019s shares or voting rights or have the right to appoint or remove the majority of the board of directors.\n\n==== Publicly Traded ====\n\nOwnership information and corporate filings for publicly traded companies can be found on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) and the Companies Registry websites. Public companies must have at least two directors and one secretary registered.\n\n==== Privately Held ====\n\nThe Companies Registry often contains shareholder information for privately held companies. Ownership and subsidiary information can sometimes be found in the accounts section of the filings.

Non-profits are often set up like this. There is no share capital, and its members are the guarantors.\n\n==== Private Unlimited Company ====\n\nThere is no cap to the amount that its members are required to pay if the company is wound up. These companies are not required by law to submit annual accounts, making them attractive for maintaining financial secrecy.\n\n==== Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) ====\n\nAn LLP is owned by its members, who are liable for the amount of money they invest plus any personal guarantees. There is no restriction on the number of partners, but there must be at least two on incorporation. They are solely for profit-making businesses.\n\n==== Limited Partnership (LP) ====\n\nThis business association includes general and limited partners. General partners are personally liable for the partnership\u2019s debts, while limited partners' liability is capped to the amount of their investment.\n\n==== Societas Europaea, or SE companies ====\n\nSE companies can be established in all European Economic Areas. In Hong Kong, they operate similarly to public limited companies and can be formed through mergers or as subsidiaries or holding companies.\n</div>\n</details>",

The search results will be organized by tabs. To refine your results to companies, click the relevant tab. If searching for disqualified directors, search for their name and then click the 'Disqualifications' tab. Once you click on a company name, you will be brought through to its Overview page. Again, click on the relevant tab to access filings (Filing History), info on officers and PSCs (People), and current and former charges (Charges). In the Filing History tab, you can refine the filings by category by clicking on the relevant box at the top \u2013 for example, you can view Accounts, filings relating to officers, etc. NOTE: it's always a good idea to review the filing history in full as well because sometimes the filtered version does not pick up on relevant documents (e.g., filings that were resubmitted due to an error in the original).\n\nCompany records are retained by the Jamaica Office of the Registrar of Companies for 20 years after a company is dissolved and struck off. Companies are also required to register incorporation details (including previous names), charges/mortgages, and insolvency information, and file annual reports (full accounts) and annual confirmation statements.\n\nFor full date of birth, including the day, look for documents submitted before 2016.\n\nFor '''archived company details and reports''', use [OCCRP Aleph](https://data.occrp.org/) (''civ'') and/or one of the following services:\n* [Company Check](https://companycheck.co.uk) (''priv'')\n* [DueDil](https://www.duedil.com) (''priv'')\n* [Endole](https://www.endole.co.uk) (''priv'')\n\n* [https://www.orcjamaica.com/CompanySearch.aspx?cId1=ab498fb6-5ae9-46fd-ab4f-09c778c557f0 Companies Office of Jamaica -] Search by name or number for company address, incorporation date, and status (''pub'', ''paid'')\n\n===Ownership===\n\n*generally available\n:-reverse: in random cases only, on [OCCRP Aleph](https://data.occrp.org/) (''civ'')\n\n===Directorship===\n\n* available\n:- reverse: yes\n\n===Company Types===\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\n''Details''\n\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n'''Private Company Limited by Shares'''\n\nThis is the most common company type. The amount for which shareholders are liable in the event that the company is wound up is limited to the face value of their share in the business. The company cannot sell shares to the general public.\n\n'''Public Limited Company (PLC)'''\n\nThis type can sell shares to the general public. It must have share capital of a specified amount, and the liability of the company is limited to the value of its reserves.\n\n'''Private Company Limited by Guarantee'''\n\nThis type limits the liability of its guarantors to a pre-agreed amount that they have to pay if the company is wound up. Non-profits are often set up like this. There is no share capital or shareholders in this company. Its members/owners are the guarantors.\n\n'''Private Unlimited Company'''\n\nThere is no cap to the amount that its members are required to pay if the company is wound up, so they tend to be used for companies where insolvency is a very low risk. They are not required by law to submit annual accounts to the Registrar. This makes unlimited companies attractive to businesses that wish to maintain a level of secrecy about their financial status.\n\n'''Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)'''\n\nAn LLP is owned by its members who have certain responsibilities, including acting in accordance with the partnership agreement. Its members (partners) are only liable for the amount of money they invest, plus any personal guarantees. There's no restriction on the maximum number of partners allowed but there must be at least two members on incorporation, either individuals or limited companies. They are solely for profit-making businesses.\n\n'''Limited Partnership (LP)'''\n\nThis is a business association of one or more 'general partners' alongside one or more 'limited partners'. It is the general partner who is personally liable for the partnership's debts and other obligations. Where there is more than one general partner, they are jointly liable for the partnership's debts. Liability is potentially unlimited, so they may face losing personal assets. Each limited partner's personal liability is capped to the amount of their investment (and any personal guarantees they have given). While their original investment may be lost in paying off partnership debts, the limited partner's personal assets cannot be accessed by creditors.\n\n'''Societas Europaea (SE companies)'''\n\nThese can be established in all European Economic Area countries. When established in Jamaica, SEs are a type of public limited company which can be formed as a subsidiary of another company or as a holding company. SE companies can also be created by mergers or from an existing PLC.\n</div>\n</div>",

Judges look to past, relevant precedential decisions and apply their principles to the legal questions before them. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision. Written opinions for precedent-setting decisions are published online as they are of significance and interest to the general public and legal practitioners alike. Case briefs mainly serve to show how a legal decision was arrived at, which requires, to some extent, recounting the circumstances of the underlying dispute. Personal data may be published in judgments, the GDPR notwithstanding. Court records for cases that are neither precedent-setting nor of public importance are not publicly available. The most comprehensive, online Jamaican case law databases are maintained by the Supreme Court website and the Caribbean Court of Justice website. These databases allow for all courts to be searched at once, making knowledge of the subject's address history unessential.\n</div>\n</div>\n\n===Sources===\n\n* [Supreme Court Jamaica](http://www.supremecourt.gov.jm/) (''pub'')\n* [Caribbean Court of Justice](http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/judgments-proceedings) (''civ'')\n* [http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/judgments-proceedings/appellate-jurisdiction-judgments/ Caribbean Court of Justice -] Appellate jurisdiction and original jurisdiction judgements available as searchable PDFs (''pub'')\n* [http://www.supremecourt.gov.jm/ Jamaican Supreme Court - Contains] full text judgments (''pub'')\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\n''Details''\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\nThe Caribbean Court of Justice is the judicial body for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).

        "wiki_content": "Various sources of corporate records are available in Morocco.\n\n===National Enterprise Register===\n\n'''[Link to the relevant source]'''\n\nMorocco's National Enterprise Register is managed at the national level by the relevant government body. The search engine supports searches by company name, number, and other characteristics. Company pages on the Enterprise Register give basic information, including those listed below. Directors, other principals, and UBOs (where disclosed as required) are identified, with the DOBs of directors and UBOs given.\n\n* Name\n* Corporate ID\n* Activity\n* Entity type\n* Share capital\n* Wholly-owned (Y/N)\n* Branch registrations\n* Date of registration with its current commercial court\n\nNote: The company's date of ''registration'' may not be its date of ''incorporation''. Look for a date of activity commencement or historical filings to check.\n\n===Commercial Court Registry Database===\n\n'''[Link to the relevant source]'''\n\nThe older corporate database, maintained by the Commercial Court Registries. Compared to the National Enterprise Register, this database may only offer corporate filings for a fee. However, it does offer various company details for free, including those listed below. Directors and other principals are listed.\n\n* Address\n* Trade name\n* Legal form\n* Last year's turnover (where declared)\n* Activity\n* Branch registrations\n* Date of registration at the current Commercial Court\n\nFurther detailed documents may be obtained for a fee. The most useful of these are individual filings and annual accounts.\n\n===Commercial Gazette Records===\n\n'''[Link to the relevant source]'''\n\nThe Official Bulletin of Announcements regularly publishes announcements that companies are required to make on changes made. It may be searched by company name or ID, and also by keyword, which can identify directors.\n\n===Free Corporate Filings===\n\n'''[Link to the relevant source]'''\n\nThis database provides basic identity data on companies and, if available, a table presenting details from their most recent accounts. Further down the company page, a list of the company's corporate announcements is given. Beyond the corporate announcements, the database lists the company's corporate filings and makes them available for free download.\n\n===Associations and Foundations===\n\n'''[Link to the relevant source]'''\n\nThe Official Journal publishes announcements by associations and foundations (charities).\n\n===Note on Identifying Ownership===\n\nOwnership identification can be complex in Morocco. Always check a public company's accounts first to save time.\n\nMoroccan companies declare changes in ownership in individual filings to the corporate registries. These filings are available through the '''National Enterprise Register''', '''Commercial Court Registry Database''' (for a fee), and '''Free Corporate Filings''' (overall best option). Scrolling down the list of filings, look for ones described as a change to share capital. Typically, these will consist of notes on a company shareholder meeting detailing the change, and then updated company statutes.\n\n===Directorships===\n\nDirectorship searches are available through all of the official corporate records sources listed above, namely:\n\n* '''[Link to the relevant source]''' - search by name, surname, and birthdate through the Advanced Search\n* '''[Link to the relevant source]''' - search by name, surname through the Advanced Search\n* '''[Link to the relevant source]''' - search director's \"[surname, name]\" as a keyword\n* '''[Link to the relevant source]''' - Provides a surname/name search for directors and sole partnerships.\n\nNote that while a register of disqualified directors exists in Morocco, it is not publicly accessible.\n\n===Additional Corporate Registry Resources===\n\n* [https://www.directinfo.ma/ Moroccan Office of Industrial and] Commercial Property database search function covering companies and trademarks with basic company data available for free (''pub'', ''paid'')\n\n* [http://www.ammc.ma/en Moroccan Authority of Capital Markets] with issuer information, management details, incorporation data, shareholder and financial information (''pub'')\n\n* [http://www.directinfo.ma/ Database of companies searchable by] company name, patent, design and other keywords (''pub'', ''paid'')\n\n* [http://www.mahakim.ma/Ar/Services/RC/?Page=RC Moroccan e-justice portal offering limited] corporate data with searches requiring selection of the correct commercial court (''pub'')\n\n* [https://servicesenligne.justice.gov.ma/Home/Index Ministry of Justice corporate extracts] providing basic corporate data including personal details of directors (''pub'', ''paid'')\n\n* [http://www.casablanca-bourse.com Casablanca Stock Exchange]  (''pub'')",

Unlike common law systems, judicial decisions do not have a binding precedent, but they may still influence future rulings. Legal outcomes and the interpretation of codes rely heavily on strict adherence to statutory law and legal scholarship. Searchable legal databases in Spain include multiple resources that encompass various levels of courts and tribunals. These databases provide access to judicial decisions, although the focus is primarily on statutory law.\n\n'''[http://www.poderjudicial.es Consejo General del Poder Judicial]''' This body supervises the judiciary and maintains records of judicial decisions made across Spain.

We have an account, and when logged in some extra information should be visible, so it's best to do that. \n\nThis website has a simple search function where you can enter the name of a company or an individual, and it'll search all Swiss cantons plus Liechtenstein. If you enter an individual's name, it'll show you directorships but not ownership. \n\nThe page for a company shows a decent amount of information, though not arranged in the most user-friendly way. \n\n* In the first section (\"\u00dcbersicht\" in German), you can see its share capital, number of employees, address, sector of business, directors' names, incorporation date and purpose (often quite a detailed and specific description), then there's the most recent corporate filing that names them (from the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce, \"SHAB\").\n* The second section (\"Ausk\u00fcnfte\") allows you to buy various types of financial report.\n* The third section (\"Management\") shows you current and past directors, and their dates.\n* The fourth section (\"Netzwerk\") visually displays directorships and doesn't seem very useful.\n* The fifth section (\"Timeline\") shows major events on a timeline.\n* The sixth section (\"Kennzahlen\") shows some basic information already included in the first section.\n* The seventh section (\"Besitzverh\u00e4ltnisse\") should in theory list the company's shareholders and shareholdings/subsidiaries, but in practice it's very often empty/incomplete.\n* The eighth section (\"Meldungen\") lists SHAB filings.\n* The ninth section (\"Marken\") lists brands registered with the company.\n\nThe page for an individual shows more limited information: \n* The first section (\"\u00dcbersicht\") only really shows their citizenship (or for Swiss citizens, canton of origin) and place of residence (town if in Switzerland, town and country if abroad) and then provides the most recent corporate filing that mentions them.\n* The second tab (\"Ausk\u00fcnfte\") allows you to download a PDF containing the information from the first, third and fifth tabs.\n* The third tab (\"Mandate\") shows a list of past and present directorships and their dates.\n* The fourth tab (\"Netzwerk\") visualizes their connections and doesn't seem particularly useful.\n* The fifth tab (\"Beteiligungen\") should in theory show companies in which they own shares, but in practice it's usually empty.\n* The sixth tab (\"Meldungen\") provides a list of corporate filings that mention them.\n\nAs Moneyhouse is a third-party website, we don't usually cite it directly in our reports. To cite, we can either provide a link to an official website (see below) or just write something like \"Swiss corporate records\".\n\n* [http://www.moneyhouse.ch/ Online company database with director] names, shareholders, gazette notifications and registered company activity (''pub'', ''paid'')\n\n===Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce (SHAB)===\n\nThe Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce, generally known by its German acronym SHAB, has an official website at shab.ch. Its local names are Schweizerisches Handelsamtsblatt (German), Feuille officielle suisse du commerce (French) and Foglio ufficiale svizzero di commercio (Italian).\n\nThe SHAB contains entries for certain types of changes to corporate records, such as the establishment or dissolution of a company, the addition or removal of directors, and changes of company names. There are two search fields on the website's homepage, one for all entries since 2 September 2018 and one for all entries before that, back until 1999. \n\nIt's worth searching this website if the information on Moneyhouse seems questionable or incomplete, which may especially be the case when a company has changed name or address. \n\n* [https://www.shab.ch/shabforms/COMMON/application/applicationGrid.jsp?newLanguage=EN Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce] - Information about company changes and gazette notifications (''pub'')\n\n===Official cantonal corporate registries===\n\nEach Swiss canton has its own corporate registry, and although Moneyhouse generally does a good job of aggregating data from all of them, it's often a good idea to check the relevant official registry too, to be certain of up-to-date information. In some cases, the official registry may contain information that Moneyhouse lacks. As these registries are official, if they let you link directly to companies' pages, you can use these links as citations in your reports.\n\nHere are the cantonal registries:\n* Aargau https://ag.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Appenzell Inner-Rhodes https://ai.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Appenzell Outer-Rhodes https://ar.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Basel City https://bs.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Basel-Landschaft https://bl.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml \n* Bern https://be.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Fribourg https://adm.appls.fr.ch/hrcmatic/\n* Geneva https://app2.ge.ch/ecohrcinternet/ \n* Glarus https://gl.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Grisons https://gr.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Jura https://ju.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Lucerne https://lu.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Neuch\u00e2tel https://www.ne.ch/autorites/DESC/NECO/rcne/Pages/Recherche-d'entreprises.aspx\n* Nidwalden https://nw.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Obwalden https://ow.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Schaffhausen https://sh.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Schwyz https://sz.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Solothurn https://so.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* St. Gallen https://sg.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Thurgau https://tg.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Ticino https://ti.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Uri https://ur.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Valais https://vs.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Vaud https://prestations.vd.ch/pub/101266/\n* Zug https://zg.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n* Zurich https://zh.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml\n\n* [http://www.zefix.ch/ Central Business Names Index -] Official central Registry for all cantonal commercial registers in the Swiss Confederation (''pub'')\n\n* [http://www.monetas.ch/ Free database for companies and] persons with visualization of connections (''pub'', ''reg'')\n\n* [https://www.berne-x.com Berne Exchange - Stock exchange] for small and medium-sized enterprises (''pub'')\n\n* [http://www.six-swiss-exchange.com Six Swiss Exchange - Switzerland's] principal stock exchange with significant shareholders information (''pub'')\n\n* [https://www.sihk.ch/ Swiss Chambers of Commerce -] Members Search Engine with over 14,000 companies (''pub'')\n\n* [http://www.swissyello.com Switzerland Business Directory - Online] unofficial business directory (''pub'')",
