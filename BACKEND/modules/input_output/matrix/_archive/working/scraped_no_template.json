J\u2011PlatPat (www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp) is a Japanese IP database that (on the live site) exposes searches for patents, designs and trademarks and commonly supports queries by applicant/assignee name (\u51fa\u9858\u4eba\uff0f\u6a29\u5229\u8005) and by publication/application numbers (\u516c\u958b\u756a\u53f7\uff0f\u51fa\u9858\u756a\u53f7). It does not appear to expose a simple public 'company profile by numeric ID' URL pattern or an officer/director registry. To locate search endpoints, open the site and check the specific sections: \u7279\u8a31\u30fb\u5b9f\u7528\u65b0\u6848\u691c\u7d22, \u610f\u5320\u691c\u7d22, \u5546\u6a19\u691c\u7d22 \u2014 each provides name-based and document-number-based searches. If you want, I can try again with a live crawl or specific pages (e.g. the \u7279\u8a31\u691c\u7d22 page) to extract exact URL templates.",
